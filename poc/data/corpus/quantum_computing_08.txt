The variational quantum eigensolver is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm designed to find the ground-state energy of molecular Hamiltonians on near-term quantum processors by variationally optimizing a parameterized quantum circuit. The algorithm prepares a trial wavefunction on the quantum processor using a parameterized ansatz circuit, measures the expectation value of the molecular Hamiltonian decomposed into a sum of Pauli operators, and feeds the energy estimate to a classical optimizer that updates the circuit parameters to minimize the energy according to the variational principle. The unitary coupled cluster ansatz, inspired by classical coupled cluster theory, constructs the trial state by applying exponentiated cluster operators to a reference Hartree-Fock state, with the singles and doubles truncation providing a chemically accurate approximation for many molecular systems while requiring circuit depths that scale polynomially with the number of molecular orbitals. Hardware-efficient ansatzes offer an alternative approach that constructs the parameterized circuit from layers of single-qubit rotations and entangling gates native to the specific quantum hardware, minimizing circuit depth at the cost of potentially encountering barren plateau landscapes where gradients vanish exponentially with system size. The measurement overhead of the variational quantum eigensolver arises from the need to estimate the expectation value of each Pauli term in the Hamiltonian decomposition separately, with grouping strategies that identify sets of simultaneously measurable commuting operators reducing the total number of required measurements. Classical optimizers employed in the variational loop include gradient-based methods such as L-BFGS-B and Adam, as well as gradient-free methods including COBYLA and Nelder-Mead, with the choice of optimizer affecting convergence speed and susceptibility to local minima. Error mitigation techniques including zero-noise extrapolation, probabilistic error cancellation, and symmetry verification improve the accuracy of variational quantum eigensolver calculations on noisy devices without the full overhead of quantum error correction.
