SNARE proteins are the core molecular machinery mediating membrane fusion throughout the endomembrane system, with the assembly of cognate SNARE complexes providing the mechanical force to bring opposing lipid bilayers into close apposition and drive their merger. The SNARE superfamily is classified into Q-SNAREs contributing glutamine residues and R-SNAREs contributing an arginine residue to the zero ionic layer at the center of the assembled four-helix bundle, with functional fusion complexes typically composed of one R-SNARE and three Q-SNARE motifs from the Qa, Qb, and Qc subfamilies. Syntaxin-1, SNAP-25, and VAMP2/synaptobrevin constitute the neuronal SNARE complex that drives synaptic vesicle exocytosis, with the parallel assembly of their SNARE motifs from the amino-terminal toward the membrane-proximal carboxy-terminal end generating a progressive zippering force estimated at 35 piconewtons per complex. The energy released during SNARE complex formation is sufficient to overcome the repulsive hydration forces and the energy barrier for hemifusion stalk formation, with multiple SNARE complexes cooperating at each fusion site to accelerate the kinetics of membrane merger. SM proteins, including Munc18-1 at the synapse and Vps33 in the endolysosomal pathway, function as essential regulators of SNARE complex assembly by clasping the SNARE bundle and templating the correct pairing of cognate SNAREs. Following membrane fusion, the ATPase NSF is recruited to the cis-SNARE complex by its adaptor protein alpha-SNAP and catalyzes the ATP-dependent disassembly of the extraordinarily stable SNARE bundle, recycling individual SNARE proteins for subsequent rounds of fusion. Compartment-specific SNARE complexes ensure the fidelity of membrane trafficking, with distinct combinations of syntaxins, SNAP-25 family members, and VAMPs mediating fusion at the plasma membrane, early endosomes, late endosomes, lysosomes, and the Golgi apparatus. Botulinum neurotoxins and tetanus neurotoxin are zinc-dependent metalloproteases that cleave specific SNARE proteins to block neurotransmitter release, causing the life-threatening conditions of botulism and tetanus.
