Quantum annealing is an optimization paradigm that exploits quantum tunneling and quantum fluctuations to search for the global minimum of a cost function encoded in the ground state of a programmable Ising model Hamiltonian. The computation begins with all qubits initialized in the ground state of a transverse-field Hamiltonian whose ground state is a uniform superposition, and proceeds by adiabatically reducing the transverse field strength while simultaneously increasing the problem Hamiltonian strength over an annealing schedule. According to the adiabatic theorem, if the annealing proceeds sufficiently slowly relative to the minimum spectral gap between the ground state and first excited state encountered during the evolution, the system remains in the instantaneous ground state and arrives at the solution. D-Wave Systems has commercialized quantum annealing processors with over 5,000 superconducting flux qubits arranged in a Pegasus graph topology, where each qubit is a superconducting loop whose persistent current direction encodes the binary spin variable. The connectivity constraints of the hardware graph require minor embedding techniques to map fully connected problem graphs onto the native qubit topology, introducing overhead through the use of chains of physical qubits representing single logical variables coupled ferromagnetically. Quantum annealing has been applied to optimization problems in logistics, finance, machine learning, and materials science, although demonstrating unambiguous quantum speedup over classical optimization heuristics such as simulated annealing and parallel tempering remains an open challenge. Reverse annealing, a protocol in which the anneal starts from a classical candidate solution and temporarily increases quantum fluctuations to explore the local energy landscape, enables refined local search around known good solutions. The theoretical framework connecting quantum annealing to computational complexity involves the quantum adiabatic algorithm's polynomial equivalence to the gate model of quantum computation, establishing that quantum annealing with sufficiently general Hamiltonians is universal for quantum computation.
