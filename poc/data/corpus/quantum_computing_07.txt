Quantum key distribution enables two parties to establish a shared secret cryptographic key whose security is guaranteed by the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics rather than computational assumptions about the difficulty of mathematical problems. The BB84 protocol, proposed by Bennett and Brassard in 1984, encodes key bits in the polarization states of single photons prepared randomly in one of two conjugate bases, with the sender Alice transmitting photons and the receiver Bob independently choosing a measurement basis for each received photon. After transmission, Alice and Bob publicly compare their basis choices over an authenticated classical channel and retain only the measurement outcomes where their bases coincided, forming the sifted key. Eavesdropping by an adversary Eve necessarily introduces detectable errors due to the no-cloning theorem and the disturbance caused by measurement on non-orthogonal quantum states, allowing Alice and Bob to estimate the quantum bit error rate and abort the protocol if it exceeds a security threshold. Privacy amplification and error correction procedures applied to the sifted key produce a shorter but information-theoretically secure final key about which any potential eavesdropper has exponentially vanishing information. The E91 protocol, proposed by Artur Ekert, bases key distribution on the measurement correlations of entangled photon pairs, with violations of Bell inequalities certifying the absence of eavesdropping in a device-independent manner. Practical quantum key distribution systems employ attenuated laser pulses with decoy state protocols to counteract photon number splitting attacks that exploit multi-photon pulses, achieving secure key rates over fiber-optic distances exceeding 400 kilometers. Satellite-based quantum key distribution, demonstrated by the Chinese Micius satellite, extends the reach of secure key exchange to intercontinental distances by circumventing the exponential fiber loss that limits terrestrial implementations. Integration of quantum key distribution with trusted node networks and quantum repeater technology is progressing toward a global quantum-secured internet.
