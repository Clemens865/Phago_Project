Cytokinesis is the final stage of cell division in which the cytoplasm of a single cell is partitioned into two daughter cells following chromosome segregation during anaphase. In animal cells, cytokinesis is accomplished by the assembly and constriction of a contractile ring composed of antiparallel actin filaments and bipolar myosin II minifilaments positioned at the cell equator in a plane perpendicular to the mitotic spindle axis. The position of the cleavage furrow is determined by signals emanating from the central spindle, a bundle of antiparallel microtubules formed between segregating chromosomes, and from the astral microtubules that contact the cell cortex. The centralspindlin complex, comprising MKLP1 and CYK-4, localizes to the midzone of the central spindle and recruits the RhoGEF ECT2 to activate the small GTPase RhoA at the equatorial cortex. RhoA activation stimulates formins to nucleate unbranched actin filaments and activates Rho kinase to phosphorylate the myosin regulatory light chain, promoting myosin II motor activity and filament assembly. As the contractile ring constricts, new membrane must be delivered to the cleavage furrow through targeted vesicle trafficking from recycling endosomes and secretory vesicles, a process requiring Rab11 and the exocyst tethering complex. The final step of cytokinesis, termed abscission, involves the severing of the intercellular bridge connecting the two nascent daughter cells, mediated by the ESCRT-III complex that polymerizes into helical filaments and constricts the narrow membrane neck. The abscission checkpoint, mediated by Aurora B kinase at the midbody, delays final membrane scission when chromatin bridges persist, preventing chromosome breakage and ensuring genomic integrity.
