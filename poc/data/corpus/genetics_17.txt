Chromatin structure is the hierarchical organization of eukaryotic DNA into a compacted nucleoprotein fiber that packages approximately two meters of DNA into the micrometer-scale cell nucleus while maintaining regulated access to genetic information. The fundamental repeating unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, consisting of 147 base pairs of DNA wrapped in 1.65 left-handed superhelical turns around an octamer of core histone proteins comprising two copies each of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Linker histone H1 binds nucleosomes at the entry and exit sites of DNA and facilitates higher-order chromatin compaction into the 30-nanometer fiber, although the existence of this regular structure in vivo has been challenged by cryo-electron microscopy studies suggesting a more disordered polymer-melt organization. Euchromatin refers to the decondensed, transcriptionally permissive chromatin state enriched in acetylated histones and H3K4 methylation, while heterochromatin exists in a condensed, transcriptionally silent form subdivided into constitutive heterochromatin at pericentromeric and telomeric regions marked by H3K9me3 and HP1, and facultative heterochromatin at developmentally silenced loci marked by H3K27me3. Topologically associating domains represent megabase-scale chromatin compartments within which genomic sequences interact more frequently with each other than with sequences in adjacent domains, as revealed by chromosome conformation capture and Hi-C technologies. The cohesin complex and the insulator protein CTCF establish topologically associating domain boundaries through a loop extrusion mechanism in which cohesin progressively extrudes DNA loops until stalled by convergently oriented CTCF binding sites. Phase separation of multivalent chromatin-binding proteins into liquid-like condensates has emerged as a mechanism for compartmentalizing the nucleus into functional domains including heterochromatin foci, nucleoli, and transcription factories.
