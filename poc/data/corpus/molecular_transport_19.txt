Phagocytosis is the receptor-mediated process by which specialized immune cells including macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells engulf and internalize large particles such as bacteria, apoptotic cells, and debris into membrane-bound compartments called phagosomes for degradation and antigen processing. The phagocytic process begins with particle recognition by surface receptors, including Fc-gamma receptors that bind immunoglobulin G-opsonized targets, complement receptors that recognize C3b-coated particles, and pattern recognition receptors such as dectin-1 that directly bind pathogen-associated molecular patterns including beta-glucan on fungal cell walls. Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis proceeds through the zipper mechanism in which sequential receptor-ligand interactions drive the progressive extension of pseudopods around the particle surface, powered by localized actin polymerization regulated by the Rho family GTPases CDC42 and Rac1 through their effectors WASP and the Arp2/3 complex. Phosphoinositide signaling orchestrates phagocytic cup formation, with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate at the advancing pseudopod tips activating actin regulators, followed by its conversion to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate by class I PI3-kinases that promotes pseudopod closure and phagosome sealing. The nascent phagosome undergoes a maturation program through sequential fusion with early endosomes, late endosomes, and lysosomes, acquiring the vacuolar ATPase to acidify its lumen, Rab7 to direct late endosomal fusion, and lysosomal hydrolases including cathepsins that degrade internalized material. The NADPH oxidase complex NOX2 is assembled on the phagosomal membrane where it generates superoxide anions that are converted to hypochlorous acid by myeloperoxidase, providing potent microbicidal activity within the phagolysosome. Efferocytosis, the phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells, is mediated by receptors recognizing phosphatidylserine exposed on the outer leaflet of dying cells and is essential for preventing secondary necrosis and inflammatory tissue damage.
