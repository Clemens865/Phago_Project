Aquaporins are a family of integral membrane proteins that form water-selective channels facilitating the rapid osmotic transport of water molecules across biological membranes at rates approaching three billion molecules per channel per second. The prototypical aquaporin, AQP1, was discovered by Peter Agre in erythrocyte membranes and forms homotetramers in which each monomer contains an independent water pore lined by two highly conserved asparagine-proline-alanine motifs that fold into the membrane as half-helices to form the selectivity filter. The narrow constriction region of the aquaporin pore, measuring approximately 2.8 angstroms in diameter, permits the single-file passage of water molecules while excluding protons through the combined effects of electrostatic repulsion by the NPA helical dipoles and steric constraints that prevent the formation of a continuous hydrogen-bonded water chain. Aquaglyceroporins, including AQP3, AQP7, and AQP9, possess wider pore diameters and additionally transport glycerol, urea, and other small neutral solutes, playing important roles in glycerol metabolism in adipose tissue and the liver. In the kidney, aquaporin expression along the nephron is precisely regulated to achieve water homeostasis, with constitutive AQP1 expression in the proximal tubule and descending thin limb mediating approximately 90 percent of filtered water reabsorption, while vasopressin-regulated trafficking of AQP2 to the apical membrane of collecting duct principal cells provides the fine-tuning of water reabsorption that determines final urine concentration. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, characterized by the inability to concentrate urine in response to vasopressin, results from mutations in AQP2 or the vasopressin V2 receptor that disrupt the regulated insertion of AQP2 into the apical membrane. Aquaporin-4, the predominant water channel in the brain expressed in astrocyte endfeet, facilitates brain water homeostasis and its dysfunction contributes to cerebral edema formation and the autoimmune demyelinating disease neuromyelitis optica.
