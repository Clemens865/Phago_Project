Vesicular transport moves large molecules between compartments through membrane budding and fusion. Endocytosis internalizes extracellular material by membrane invagination forming vesicles. Exocytosis releases intracellular contents by vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. Clathrin-coated pits mediate receptor-dependent endocytosis of specific ligands and nutrients.
