Vesicular transport is the mechanism by which eukaryotic cells move macromolecules, membrane proteins, and lipids between intracellular compartments and the cell surface through membrane-bound vesicles that bud from donor membranes and fuse with target membranes. Endocytosis is the internalization of extracellular material through invagination of the plasma membrane, encompassing receptor-mediated endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits, caveolae-dependent uptake through cholesterol-rich membrane invaginations, macropinocytosis for bulk fluid-phase uptake, and phagocytosis for the engulfment of large particles such as bacteria and apoptotic cells by specialized immune cells. The molecular machinery governing vesicle formation involves coat protein complexes: clathrin and its adaptor proteins for endocytic vesicles, COPI for retrograde Golgi-to-ER transport, and COPII for anterograde ER-to-Golgi transport, each recruiting specific cargo through sorting signals on transmembrane proteins. Vesicle targeting and fusion are mediated by Rab GTPases that tether vesicles to appropriate target membranes, and SNARE proteins whose complementary pairing between vesicle-associated v-SNAREs and target membrane t-SNAREs provides the energy to drive membrane fusion through the formation of a four-helix coiled-coil bundle. Exocytosis releases intracellular contents by fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane, occurring constitutively for membrane maintenance or in a regulated manner triggered by calcium influx as in neurotransmitter release at synaptic terminals. For example, in neurons, synaptic vesicles loaded with neurotransmitters by vesicular transporters are docked at the active zone by the Munc18-syntaxin complex, primed by Munc13, and rapidly fused upon calcium sensing by synaptotagmin, enabling neurotransmitter release within microseconds of an action potential and demonstrating the exquisite temporal precision achievable through regulated vesicular transport.
