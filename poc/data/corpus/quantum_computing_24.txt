Quantum cryptography protocols extend beyond quantum key distribution to encompass a family of information-theoretically secure communication primitives that exploit quantum mechanical principles to achieve functionalities impossible with classical information alone. Quantum digital signatures enable a sender to sign a message such that any recipient can verify its authenticity while no recipient can forge the signature, implemented through the distribution of quantum signature states and the symmetrization of verification keys among recipients. Quantum secret sharing distributes a classical or quantum secret among multiple parties such that only authorized subsets of participants can reconstruct the secret by combining their shares, with the no-cloning theorem ensuring that unauthorized coalitions gain no information. Quantum coin flipping protocols allow two mutually distrustful parties to agree on a random bit with bounded bias, exploiting quantum communication to achieve bias bounds provably superior to any classical protocol, although a perfectly fair quantum coin flip between two parties has been shown to be impossible without additional assumptions. Quantum oblivious transfer, a fundamental primitive for secure two-party computation, enables one party to transfer one of several messages to the other party such that the sender does not know which message was received and the receiver learns only the chosen message, with quantum protocols achieving information-theoretic security under specific assumptions. Position-based quantum cryptography uses the physical location of a participant as their sole credential, with protocols for position verification exploiting the monogamy of quantum entanglement to prevent adversaries from simulating the honest participant's responses without being at the claimed location. Device-independent quantum cryptography protocols base their security solely on the observed violation of Bell inequalities, requiring no trust in the internal workings of the quantum devices, thereby providing the strongest possible security guarantee. The composable security framework provides the rigorous mathematical foundation for proving that quantum cryptographic protocols remain secure when composed with other protocols and used as subroutines in larger cryptographic systems.
