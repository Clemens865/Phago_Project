Gap junctions are intercellular channels that directly connect the cytoplasm of adjacent cells, enabling the passage of ions, metabolites, and small signaling molecules up to approximately one kilodalton in molecular weight. Each gap junction channel is formed by the docking of two hemichannels, or connexons, contributed by neighboring cells, with each connexon assembled from six connexin subunits arranged around a central aqueous pore of approximately 1.5 nanometers in diameter. The human genome encodes twenty-one connexin genes with tissue-specific expression patterns, and the composition of connexons as homomeric or heteromeric assemblies generates functional diversity in channel permeability, gating properties, and selectivity. Gap junctional intercellular communication plays critical roles in cardiac conduction, where connexin-43 channels in ventricular cardiomyocytes propagate action potentials through the myocardium to coordinate synchronized contraction. In the developing nervous system, gap junctions between neural progenitors in the ventricular zone facilitate calcium wave propagation and metabolic coupling that coordinate cell cycle progression and neurogenesis. Connexin hemichannels that open to the extracellular space under pathological conditions release ATP and glutamate, contributing to inflammation and excitotoxicity in ischemic injury. Pannexins represent a structurally unrelated family of channel-forming glycoproteins that form large-pore channels permeable to ATP and serve as conduits for purinergic signaling during immune activation. Mutations in connexin genes cause a diverse array of human diseases, including sensorineural hearing loss from GJB2 mutations encoding connexin-26, Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy from connexin-32 mutations, and oculodentodigital dysplasia from connexin-43 mutations, underscoring the physiological importance of intercellular communication.
