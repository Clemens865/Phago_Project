Gene expression profiling encompasses the systematic measurement of transcript abundance across the genome to characterize cellular states, identify disease biomarkers, and elucidate regulatory networks governing cellular identity and function. DNA microarray technology, pioneered in the mid-1990s, enabled the simultaneous measurement of thousands of transcripts by hybridizing fluorescently labeled complementary DNA to oligonucleotide probes arrayed on glass slides, with signal intensities reflecting relative transcript abundance. RNA sequencing has largely supplanted microarrays as the method of choice for transcriptome profiling, offering greater dynamic range, single-nucleotide resolution, the ability to detect novel transcripts and splice variants, and freedom from the probe design biases inherent in hybridization-based approaches. Single-cell RNA sequencing technologies, including droplet-based methods such as 10x Genomics Chromium and plate-based methods such as Smart-seq2, have revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity by enabling transcriptome profiling of individual cells within complex tissues. Dimensionality reduction algorithms including t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding and uniform manifold approximation and projection enable visualization of single-cell transcriptomic datasets in two-dimensional space, revealing discrete cell clusters and continuous differentiation trajectories. Spatial transcriptomics methods, including multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization and Visium spatial gene expression, preserve the anatomical context of gene expression by measuring transcripts directly within tissue sections. Differential gene expression analysis employs statistical frameworks such as DESeq2 and edgeR that model count data using negative binomial distributions and apply shrinkage estimators to control for overdispersion and multiple testing. Gene set enrichment analysis and pathway analysis tools interpret expression changes in the context of curated biological knowledge bases, identifying coordinated alterations in functional modules and signaling pathways that underlie phenotypic differences between experimental conditions.
