Quantum noise channels describe the unavoidable interactions between a quantum system and its environment that degrade quantum coherence and introduce errors in quantum computation, forming the theoretical foundation for understanding decoherence and designing error mitigation and error correction strategies. The quantum channel formalism represents noisy quantum evolution through completely positive trace-preserving maps that can be expressed in the operator-sum representation using Kraus operators, with the number and structure of the Kraus operators characterizing the type and strength of the noise process. The depolarizing channel replaces the quantum state with the maximally mixed state with some probability p, modeling the worst-case isotropic noise that equally affects all Bloch sphere directions and represents the error model most commonly assumed in theoretical analyses of quantum error correction thresholds. The amplitude damping channel models energy relaxation processes in which an excited qubit spontaneously decays to its ground state by emitting a photon, characterized by the T1 relaxation time and relevant for superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and photonic systems. The phase damping channel, also known as pure dephasing, destroys the off-diagonal coherences of the density matrix without affecting populations, arising from fluctuations in the qubit transition frequency due to environmental noise and characterized by the T2 dephasing time. Correlated noise, in which errors on multiple qubits are statistically dependent due to shared environmental couplings such as global magnetic field fluctuations or crosstalk between neighboring qubits, poses additional challenges beyond the independent noise models typically assumed in error correction analyses. The Pauli twirling approximation simplifies general noise channels to stochastic Pauli channels by averaging over random Pauli gates, enabling efficient noise characterization through randomized benchmarking and Pauli noise learning protocols. Quantum process tomography provides a complete characterization of the noise channel but requires resources scaling exponentially with the number of qubits, motivating scalable alternatives including gate set tomography and cycle benchmarking for characterizing noise in large-scale quantum processors.
