Genetic recombination is the process by which segments of DNA are exchanged between homologous chromosomes during meiosis, generating novel allelic combinations that increase genetic diversity within populations. Homologous recombination is initiated by the formation of programmed DNA double-strand breaks catalyzed by the topoisomerase-like enzyme SPO11, which forms a covalent intermediate with the 5-prime ends of the cleaved DNA before being removed by the MRN complex and CtIP-mediated end resection. The resulting 3-prime single-stranded DNA overhangs are coated by the recombinase RAD51, with the assistance of mediator proteins including BRCA2, to form nucleoprotein filaments that search for and invade the homologous template through strand exchange. The displacement loop formed during strand invasion can be resolved through two mechanistically distinct pathways: the double-strand break repair pathway, which generates crossover products through double Holliday junction formation and resolution, and the synthesis-dependent strand annealing pathway, which produces exclusively non-crossover products. Crossover interference ensures that adjacent crossover events are spaced farther apart than expected by chance, with the ZMM proteins including MSH4, MSH5, and MLH1 promoting class I crossovers that display interference. The synaptonemal complex, a proteinaceous scaffold assembled between paired homologous chromosomes during prophase I, stabilizes chromosome alignment and regulates crossover distribution. Meiotic recombination hotspots are determined in mammals by the zinc finger methyltransferase PRDM9, which binds specific DNA sequence motifs and trimethylates histone H3 at lysine 4 to recruit the recombination initiation machinery. Recombination frequency between genetic loci serves as the basis for genetic mapping, with one centimorgan corresponding to approximately one percent recombination frequency between markers.
