Organelles compartmentalize cellular functions within membrane-bound structures. The endoplasmic reticulum synthesizes proteins and lipids. The Golgi apparatus processes and packages proteins for secretion. Lysosomes contain digestive enzymes that break down cellular waste and foreign material through phagocytosis and autophagy.
