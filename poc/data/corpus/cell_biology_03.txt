Organelles are membrane-bound compartments within eukaryotic cells that spatially segregate biochemical reactions, enabling metabolic processes to occur simultaneously under distinct chemical conditions. The endoplasmic reticulum exists as two continuous but functionally distinct domains: the rough endoplasmic reticulum, studded with ribosomes that co-translationally insert nascent polypeptides into the ER lumen for folding and glycosylation, and the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, which synthesizes lipids, metabolizes carbohydrates, and sequesters calcium ions used in intracellular signaling. Proteins folded in the ER are transported via COPII-coated vesicles to the Golgi apparatus, a polarized stack of cisternae organized into cis, medial, and trans compartments where sequential enzymatic modifications including glycosylation trimming, phosphorylation, and sulfation occur before cargo is sorted into vesicles destined for the plasma membrane, lysosomes, or secretory granules. Lysosomes are acidic organelles containing over sixty hydrolytic enzymes, including proteases, lipases, nucleases, and glycosidases, that degrade macromolecules internalized through endocytosis, phagocytosis, and autophagy at an optimal pH of approximately 4.5 maintained by vacuolar ATPase proton pumps. Peroxisomes complement lysosomal degradation by oxidizing very long-chain fatty acids and detoxifying reactive oxygen species through catalase activity. The endomembrane system, comprising the ER, Golgi, endosomes, and lysosomes, is interconnected by vesicular trafficking pathways regulated by Rab GTPases, SNARE proteins, and coat protein complexes. For example, in secretory cells such as pancreatic acinar cells, the coordinated function of rough ER protein synthesis, Golgi processing, and regulated exocytosis of zymogen granules illustrates how organelle specialization enables the efficient production and delivery of digestive enzymes to the intestinal lumen.
