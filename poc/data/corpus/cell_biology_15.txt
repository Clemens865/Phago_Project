Chromatin remodeling encompasses the dynamic restructuring of nucleosome positioning and histone-DNA contacts that regulates access to genetic information encoded within eukaryotic chromosomes. ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, classified into four major families including SWI/SNF, ISWI, CHD, and INO80, utilize the energy of ATP hydrolysis to slide, eject, or restructure nucleosomes along DNA, thereby modulating transcription factor access to regulatory elements. The SWI/SNF complex, frequently mutated in human cancers, contains the catalytic subunit BRG1 or BRM and disrupts histone-DNA contacts to create nucleosome-free regions at enhancers and promoters. Post-translational modifications of histone tails constitute a combinatorial histone code that recruits specific reader proteins to chromatin. Histone acetyltransferases such as p300/CBP and GCN5 acetylate lysine residues to neutralize positive charges and loosen histone-DNA interactions, generally associated with transcriptional activation. Conversely, histone deacetylases remove acetyl groups to promote chromatin compaction and transcriptional repression. Histone methylation exhibits context-dependent effects, with H3K4 trimethylation marking active promoters and H3K27 trimethylation deposited by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 marking silenced developmental genes. The histone variant H2A.Z is preferentially deposited at gene promoters by the SWR1 complex and influences nucleosome stability and transcriptional regulation. Pioneer transcription factors such as FOXA1 possess the unique ability to engage nucleosomal DNA directly, initiating chromatin opening events that enable subsequent binding of additional factors. The interplay between chromatin remodeling and DNA methylation establishes epigenetic landscapes that define cell identity and are disrupted in numerous disease states including cancer and developmental syndromes.
