Anterograde transport is the forward-directed movement of newly synthesized proteins and lipids from the endoplasmic reticulum through the Golgi apparatus to their final destinations at the plasma membrane, endosomes, lysosomes, or the extracellular space. The journey begins at endoplasmic reticulum exit sites, where properly folded cargo proteins are concentrated into COPII-coated vesicles through the sequential action of the small GTPase Sar1, the inner coat complex Sec23-Sec24 that directly engages export signals on cargo proteins, and the outer coat complex Sec13-Sec31 that polymerizes into a cage to deform the membrane into a bud. Large cargo molecules such as procollagen fibrils, which exceed the dimensions of conventional COPII vesicles, are accommodated by TANGO1 and cTAGE5, which create enlarged transport carriers at modified endoplasmic reticulum exit sites. Following uncoating, vesicles tether to the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment through the p115 tethering factor and the golgin family of coiled-coil proteins before SNARE-mediated fusion delivers the cargo for onward transport. Within the Golgi stack, cargo traverses the cis, medial, and trans cisternae where it undergoes sequential glycan processing by resident glycosyltransferases and glycosidases, with the cisternal maturation model proposing that cisternae themselves mature as recycling vesicles return Golgi enzymes to earlier compartments. At the trans-Golgi network, sorting signals direct cargo into distinct carrier populations: clathrin-coated vesicles bearing adaptor protein complexes AP-1 direct mannose-6-phosphate receptor-bound lysosomal hydrolases to endosomes, while constitutive secretory carriers deliver plasma membrane proteins and secreted molecules to the cell surface. Regulated secretory granules in specialized secretory cells such as pancreatic beta cells and chromaffin cells concentrate their cargo through aggregation in the mildly acidic trans-Golgi network and await calcium-triggered exocytosis signals for release.
