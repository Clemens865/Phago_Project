Measurement-based quantum computation is an alternative model of quantum computing in which the computation proceeds entirely through adaptive single-qubit measurements performed on a highly entangled resource state, with the measurement outcomes determining subsequent measurement bases through classical feedforward. The canonical resource state for measurement-based quantum computation is the cluster state, a many-body entangled state prepared by initializing all qubits in the plus state and applying controlled-Z gates between neighboring qubits on a lattice, generating a universal resource from which any quantum circuit can be extracted through local measurements. Single-qubit measurements in the X-Y plane of the Bloch sphere, parameterized by the measurement angle, implement rotations and entangling gates on the logical qubits encoded in the cluster state, with the inherent randomness of quantum measurement outcomes corrected through adaptive Pauli frame updates applied to subsequent measurement angles. The universality of the cluster state for quantum computation was established by Rauaussendorf and Briegel, who showed that measurements on a two-dimensional cluster state can simulate any quantum circuit with polynomial overhead, providing an exact correspondence between measurement patterns and quantum gate sequences. Fault-tolerant measurement-based quantum computation is naturally implemented through topological cluster state computation, where the three-dimensional cluster state encodes logical qubits in the Rauaussendorf-Harrington-Goyal topological code and syndrome extraction is performed through single-qubit measurements. Photonic quantum computing platforms are particularly well-suited to the measurement-based paradigm because entangled photonic cluster states can be generated through probabilistic fusion gates and photon detection provides the natural measurement mechanism, as pursued by companies including PsiQuantum and Xanadu. The concept of computational phases of matter extends measurement-based quantum computation by identifying phases of quantum many-body systems whose ground states serve as universal resources, with symmetry-protected topological phases providing a systematic framework for constructing resource states. Blind quantum computation, enabled by the measurement-based model, allows a client with minimal quantum capabilities to delegate computation to a remote quantum server without revealing the input, output, or computation being performed, providing quantum computational security guarantees impossible in classical delegation protocols.
