Superconducting qubits are the leading platform for quantum computing, exploiting the macroscopic quantum coherence of Josephson junction circuits cooled to millikelvin temperatures in dilution refrigerators to create artificial atoms with controllable energy level structures. The transmon qubit, the workhorse of modern superconducting quantum processors, consists of a Josephson junction shunted by a large capacitor that exponentially suppresses charge noise sensitivity at the cost of reduced anharmonicity, with the qubit encoded in the two lowest energy levels separated by a transition frequency typically near 5 gigahertz. Single-qubit gates are implemented through microwave pulses resonant with the qubit transition frequency, shaped using techniques such as DRAG pulse optimization to minimize leakage to non-computational levels, achieving gate fidelities exceeding 99.9 percent. Two-qubit entangling gates are realized through various coupling schemes including the cross-resonance gate, which drives one qubit at the frequency of a coupled neighbor to generate a conditional rotation, and the tunable coupler architecture that enables fast high-fidelity controlled-Z gates by modulating the effective qubit-qubit coupling. Qubit state readout employs dispersive measurement, in which the qubit-state-dependent frequency shift of a coupled microwave resonator is detected through homodyne or heterodyne measurement of the transmitted or reflected microwave signal. Coherence times of superconducting qubits have improved by over five orders of magnitude since the first demonstrations, with state-of-the-art transmons exhibiting T1 relaxation times exceeding 500 microseconds through improved materials, junction fabrication, and electromagnetic design that reduces participation ratios of lossy interfaces. Frequency-multiplexed control and readout enable the scaling of superconducting quantum processors to hundreds of qubits, as demonstrated by IBM, Google, and other organizations operating processors with over 1,000 physical qubits. The surface code, implementable on a two-dimensional grid of superconducting qubits with nearest-neighbor connectivity, provides a practical path to fault-tolerant quantum computation with error thresholds around one percent.
