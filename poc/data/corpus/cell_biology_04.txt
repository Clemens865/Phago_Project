Cell division is the fundamental biological process by which a parent cell produces daughter cells, occurring through mitosis for somatic cell proliferation and meiosis for the generation of haploid gametes in sexually reproducing organisms. Mitosis proceeds through a sequence of tightly regulated phases: prophase, in which chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes and the mitotic spindle begins to form from centrosomes; prometaphase, when the nuclear envelope breaks down and kinetochore microtubules attach to the proteinaceous kinetochore complexes assembled on centromeric DNA; metaphase, during which chromosomes align at the metaphase plate under tension from opposing spindle poles; anaphase, when cohesin cleavage by separase allows sister chromatids to be pulled toward opposite poles by microtubule depolymerization and dynein-mediated poleward flux; and telophase, in which the nuclear envelope reassembles around decondensing chromatin. The spindle assembly checkpoint, a surveillance mechanism involving proteins such as Mad2 and BubR1, delays anaphase onset until all kinetochores achieve stable bipolar attachment, preventing aneuploidy caused by chromosome missegregation. Cytokinesis physically separates the two daughter cells through formation of an actin-myosin contractile ring positioned by the central spindle and RhoA GTPase signaling, which constricts the plasma membrane to form the cleavage furrow. Cyclin-dependent kinases, particularly CDK1 complexed with cyclin B, serve as master regulators that phosphorylate hundreds of substrates to drive mitotic entry. For example, errors in the spindle assembly checkpoint that allow premature anaphase onset can lead to aneuploidy observed in many solid tumors, illustrating the critical importance of mitotic fidelity for genomic stability and tumor suppression.
