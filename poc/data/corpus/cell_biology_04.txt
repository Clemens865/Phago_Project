Cell division occurs through mitosis and meiosis. During mitosis the cell duplicates its chromosomes and divides into two identical daughter cells. The mitotic spindle composed of microtubules attaches to kinetochores on chromosomes to ensure proper segregation. Cytokinesis completes division by pinching the cell membrane through an actin contractile ring.
