Nuclear import and export are the bidirectional transport processes that shuttle macromolecules between the cytoplasm and nucleus through the nuclear pore complex, with the directionality of transport established by the asymmetric distribution of the small GTPase Ran in its GTP- and GDP-bound forms. Nuclear import of proteins bearing classical nuclear localization signals is mediated by the importin-alpha/importin-beta heterodimer, where importin-alpha serves as an adaptor that recognizes the basic amino acid-rich nuclear localization signal and importin-beta mediates translocation through the nuclear pore by interacting with phenylalanine-glycine nucleoporins. Upon arrival in the nucleus, RanGTP binds to importin-beta and induces a conformational change that releases the cargo, with importin-alpha recycled to the cytoplasm by its dedicated export factor CAS bound to RanGTP. Nuclear export of proteins containing leucine-rich nuclear export signals is mediated by the exportin CRM1, which forms a trimeric complex with RanGTP and the cargo in the nucleus and releases its cargo in the cytoplasm upon RanGAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis. The export of messenger RNA ribonucleoprotein complexes employs a distinct mechanism involving the TAP/NXF1-p15/NXT1 heterodimer, which does not require Ran for translocation but is recruited to mature mRNA through interactions with the transcription-export complex deposited during co-transcriptional mRNA processing. Transfer RNA export is mediated by exportin-t, which recognizes the mature tRNA structure including the amino acid acceptor stem and the T-psi-C loop as part of a quality control mechanism that ensures only properly processed tRNAs reach the cytoplasmic translation machinery. Ribosomal subunit export requires dedicated export adaptors including NMD3 for the large subunit and multiple export factors for the small subunit, reflecting the complexity of exporting these megadalton-scale ribonucleoprotein particles through the nuclear pore.
