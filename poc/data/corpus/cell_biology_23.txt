The cellular stress response encompasses a network of adaptive mechanisms that enable cells to detect, respond to, and recover from environmental and intracellular perturbations including heat shock, oxidative stress, hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, and genotoxic insults. The heat shock response, mediated by heat shock factor 1, rapidly induces the expression of molecular chaperones including HSP90, HSP70, and small heat shock proteins that prevent protein aggregation and facilitate refolding of denatured substrates. Oxidative stress activates the Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway, where electrophilic modification of cysteine residues on the inhibitor Keap1 releases the transcription factor Nrf2 to translocate to the nucleus and drive expression of phase II detoxification enzymes, glutathione synthesis genes, and antioxidant proteins including heme oxygenase-1 and thioredoxin. The hypoxia-inducible factor pathway responds to reduced oxygen tension through the stabilization of HIF-1alpha, which is constitutively hydroxylated by prolyl hydroxylase domain enzymes and targeted for proteasomal degradation by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor under normoxic conditions. The DNA damage response activates checkpoint kinases ATM and ATR, which phosphorylate hundreds of substrates to arrest the cell cycle, stimulate repair pathways, and trigger apoptosis when damage is irreparable. The integrated stress response converges on the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha by four stress-sensing kinases including PERK, GCN2, HRI, and PKR, resulting in global translation attenuation coupled with selective upregulation of stress-responsive mRNAs including ATF4. Failure to resolve cellular stress through these adaptive mechanisms leads to programmed cell death through apoptosis, necroptosis, or ferroptosis depending on the nature and severity of the insult.
