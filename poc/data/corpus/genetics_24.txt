Genetic drift is the stochastic fluctuation of allele frequencies in finite populations caused by the random sampling of gametes during reproduction, a process whose magnitude is inversely proportional to the effective population size. In small populations, drift can lead to the rapid fixation or loss of alleles regardless of their selective value, reducing genetic diversity and increasing the frequency of deleterious alleles through a process distinct from natural selection. The founder effect occurs when a small number of individuals establish a new population, carrying only a subset of the genetic variation present in the source population, as exemplified by the elevated frequency of Ellis-van Creveld syndrome among the Old Order Amish descended from a small founding group in the 18th century. Population bottlenecks, in which a large population is temporarily reduced to a small number of surviving individuals, similarly reduce genetic diversity, as evidenced by the remarkably low mitochondrial DNA diversity in cheetahs attributable to a severe bottleneck approximately 10,000 years ago. The Wright-Fisher model provides the mathematical framework for genetic drift, describing allele frequency change as a binomial sampling process in an idealized population of constant size with discrete non-overlapping generations. The diffusion approximation extends this model to continuous time, deriving the probability distribution of allele frequencies and expected times to fixation or loss as functions of effective population size and initial allele frequency. Neutral alleles fix at a rate equal to the mutation rate, a fundamental result of neutral theory that connects the molecular clock to population genetic parameters. Genetic drift interacts with natural selection in a manner determined by the product of effective population size and the selection coefficient, with alleles behaving effectively as neutral when this product is much less than one, explaining why slightly deleterious mutations accumulate more readily in species with small effective population sizes such as island endemics and endangered species.
