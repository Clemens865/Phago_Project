Endocytosis regulation governs the internalization of plasma membrane proteins, lipids, and extracellular molecules through vesicular trafficking pathways that modulate receptor signaling, nutrient uptake, and membrane composition. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis represents the best-characterized pathway, involving the sequential recruitment of adaptor protein complex AP-2, clathrin triskelions, and accessory factors to form coated pits that invaginate and pinch off through the GTPase activity of dynamin. The endocytic machinery is tightly regulated by phosphoinositide metabolism, with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate at the plasma membrane recruiting endocytic adaptors and its conversion to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate marking early endosomes. Rab GTPases serve as molecular switches that define endosomal identity and direct vesicular trafficking, with Rab5 governing early endosome fusion and Rab7 mediating the transition to late endosomes and lysosomes. The ESCRT machinery, comprising four multiprotein complexes, recognizes ubiquitinated cargo on endosomal membranes and drives intraluminal vesicle formation to generate multivesicular bodies destined for lysosomal degradation. Receptor recycling through the recycling endosome is mediated by Rab11 and the retromer complex, which sorts receptors away from the degradative pathway and returns them to the cell surface. The balance between recycling and degradation determines receptor surface levels and thus cellular sensitivity to extracellular ligands. Epidermal growth factor receptor downregulation through endolysosomal degradation exemplifies how endocytic trafficking attenuates mitogenic signaling, with CBL-mediated ubiquitination directing internalized receptors toward multivesicular bodies rather than recycling compartments. Disruption of endocytic regulation has been linked to developmental disorders, neurodegeneration, and cancer progression.
