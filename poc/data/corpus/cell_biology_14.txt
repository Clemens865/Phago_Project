The nuclear pore complex is a massive macromolecular assembly of approximately 125 megadaltons embedded in the nuclear envelope, serving as the sole gateway for bidirectional transport between the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm. Each nuclear pore complex is composed of approximately thirty distinct nucleoporin proteins arranged in an eightfold rotational symmetry, forming a central transport channel of roughly 40 nanometers in diameter that permits passive diffusion of small molecules while selectively gating the passage of larger macromolecular cargo. Phenylalanine-glycine repeat nucleoporins, known as FG-Nups, line the central channel and create a selective permeability barrier through the formation of a hydrogel-like meshwork that excludes inert macromolecules above approximately 40 kilodaltons. Nuclear import receptors of the importin-beta superfamily, also called karyopherins, recognize nuclear localization signals on cargo proteins and facilitate their translocation through the pore by transiently dissolving FG-repeat interactions. The directionality of nuclear transport is established by the RanGTP gradient, maintained by the chromatin-associated guanine nucleotide exchange factor RCC1 in the nucleus and the GTPase-activating protein RanGAP1 in the cytoplasm. Exportin-mediated transport of ribosomal subunits, tRNA, and mRNA ribonucleoprotein complexes requires the formation of trimeric export complexes with RanGTP in the nucleus, which disassemble upon GTP hydrolysis in the cytoplasm. The nuclear pore complex also serves as a platform for chromatin organization, with nucleoporin-associated genomic regions exhibiting distinct transcriptional states. Defects in nucleoporin genes have been implicated in primary biliary cholangitis, acute myeloid leukemia, and accelerated aging syndromes such as Hutchinson-Gilford progeria.
