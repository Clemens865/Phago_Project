Mitochondria are double-membrane-bound organelles that serve as the primary site of aerobic energy production in eukaryotic cells, generating adenosine triphosphate through the process of oxidative phosphorylation coupled to the electron transport chain embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The electron transport chain consists of four multi-subunit protein complexes: Complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) accepts electrons from NADH and transfers them to ubiquinone while pumping four protons across the inner membrane; Complex II (succinate dehydrogenase) oxidizes FADH2 from the citric acid cycle without proton translocation; Complex III (cytochrome bc1) transfers electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c while pumping four protons; and Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) catalyzes the final transfer of electrons to molecular oxygen, producing water and pumping two protons. The resulting proton-motive force, comprising both a chemical gradient (delta pH) and an electrical potential (delta psi) of approximately 180 millivolts across the inner membrane, drives the rotary catalysis of ATP synthase (Complex V), which couples proton flow through its Fo channel to conformational changes in the F1 catalytic subunit that phosphorylate ADP to ATP. The chemiosmotic hypothesis, proposed by Peter Mitchell and validated by subsequent structural and biochemical studies, established that the proton gradient rather than a direct chemical intermediate links electron transport to ATP synthesis. Mitochondria also play critical roles in calcium homeostasis, reactive oxygen species signaling, and the regulation of intrinsic apoptosis through cytochrome c release. For example, during intense skeletal muscle contraction, the rate of mitochondrial ATP production increases severalfold through allosteric activation of dehydrogenases by elevated calcium and ADP concentrations, matching energy supply to the dramatically increased demand of actomyosin cross-bridge cycling.
