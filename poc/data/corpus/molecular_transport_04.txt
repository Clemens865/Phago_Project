Mitochondria produce ATP through oxidative phosphorylation in the electron transport chain. NADH and FADH2 donate electrons to protein complexes embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The proton gradient generated drives ATP synthase to catalyze phosphorylation of ADP. Each glucose molecule yields approximately thirty ATP molecules through complete aerobic respiration.
