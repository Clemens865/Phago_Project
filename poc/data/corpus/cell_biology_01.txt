The cell membrane, also known as the plasma membrane, is a phospholipid bilayer that forms the selectively permeable outer boundary of every living cell, separating the intracellular cytoplasm from the extracellular environment. Each phospholipid molecule consists of a hydrophilic head group containing a phosphate moiety and two hydrophobic fatty acid tails, and this amphipathic nature drives the spontaneous assembly of the bilayer in aqueous solution through the hydrophobic effect. The fluid mosaic model, proposed by Singer and Nicolson in 1972, describes the membrane as a dynamic two-dimensional fluid in which lipids and proteins diffuse laterally, enabling processes such as signal transduction, membrane fusion, and cell migration. Integral membrane proteins span the entire bilayer and function as ion channels, transporters, receptors, and enzymes, while peripheral membrane proteins associate with the membrane surface through electrostatic interactions and participate in cytoskeletal anchoring and signal relay. Cholesterol molecules intercalate between phospholipid tails to modulate membrane fluidity, decreasing fluidity at high temperatures by restricting phospholipid movement and preventing crystallization at low temperatures by disrupting tight packing. Glycolipids and glycoproteins on the extracellular face form the glycocalyx, a carbohydrate-rich layer involved in cell-cell recognition, adhesion, and immune surveillance. Lipid rafts are cholesterol- and sphingolipid-enriched microdomains that concentrate specific proteins to facilitate signaling cascades, including those initiated by receptor tyrosine kinases and G-protein coupled receptors. For example, during phagocytosis in macrophages, membrane remodeling driven by phosphatidylinositol phosphates recruits actin-nucleating complexes to the site of particle engulfment, demonstrating how the dynamic composition of the phospholipid bilayer directly coordinates cellular function with structural architecture.
