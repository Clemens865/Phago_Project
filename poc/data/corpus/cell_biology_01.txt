The cell membrane is a phospholipid bilayer that forms the outer boundary of every living cell. Integral membrane proteins span the bilayer and serve as channels, receptors, and enzymes. The fluid mosaic model describes the dynamic nature of the membrane, where lipids and proteins move laterally within the layer. Cholesterol molecules intercalate between phospholipids to modulate membrane fluidity and stability.
