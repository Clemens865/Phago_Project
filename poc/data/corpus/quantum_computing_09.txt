The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm is a variational quantum algorithm designed to find approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems by alternating between a problem-dependent phase-separation operator and a mixing operator applied to an initial uniform superposition state. The algorithm encodes the optimization objective as a classical cost function Hamiltonian whose ground state corresponds to the optimal solution, then applies p alternating layers of the cost Hamiltonian evolution and the transverse-field mixer, with 2p variational parameters controlling the rotation angles. At circuit depth p equal to one, the QAOA reduces to a quantum relaxation of the classical problem that can be analytically optimized for certain graph structures, while increasing p systematically improves the approximation ratio, with the algorithm converging to the exact solution in the limit of infinite depth. For the MaxCut problem on regular graphs, QAOA at depth one achieves an approximation ratio that provably exceeds random assignment, and numerical studies suggest competitive performance with classical algorithms at moderate circuit depths. The performance of QAOA is intimately connected to the structure of the underlying problem graph, with concentration phenomena enabling the transfer of optimized parameters between problem instances sharing similar local structure. Warm-starting strategies that initialize QAOA parameters from classical approximate solutions or from lower-depth optimized parameters accelerate convergence and improve solution quality. Extensions of the original QAOA framework include the Grover-mixer QAOA that preserves feasibility constraints by replacing the transverse-field mixer with a Grover diffusion operator restricted to the feasible subspace, and the multi-angle QAOA that assigns independent parameters to each qubit and interaction term. The theoretical analysis of QAOA's computational power relative to classical algorithms remains an active area of research, with connections to the PCP theorem and the unique games conjecture suggesting that proving unconditional quantum advantage for optimization may require resolving deep questions in computational complexity theory.
