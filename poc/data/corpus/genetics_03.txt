Translation occurs at ribosomes where messenger RNA codons are decoded into amino acid sequences. Transfer RNA molecules carry specific amino acids and recognize codons through anticodon base pairing. The ribosome catalyzes peptide bond formation between adjacent amino acids. Protein folding into functional three-dimensional structures occurs co-translationally and post-translationally with chaperone assistance.
