Translation is the process by which ribosomes decode the nucleotide sequence of messenger RNA into a polypeptide chain of amino acids, representing the final step in the central dogma of molecular biology whereby genetic information flows from DNA through RNA to protein. The ribosome is a large ribonucleoprotein complex consisting of a small subunit (40S in eukaryotes, 30S in prokaryotes) that decodes the mRNA and a large subunit (60S in eukaryotes, 50S in prokaryotes) that catalyzes peptide bond formation through the peptidyl transferase activity of its 23S or 28S ribosomal RNA, making the ribosome fundamentally a ribozyme. Translation initiates when the small ribosomal subunit, loaded with initiator methionyl-tRNA and eukaryotic initiation factors including eIF4E that recognizes the five-prime cap, scans the mRNA in the five-prime to three-prime direction until it encounters the start codon AUG in an optimal Kozak sequence context, whereupon the large subunit joins to form the complete 80S ribosome. During elongation, aminoacyl-tRNAs are delivered to the ribosomal A site as ternary complexes with elongation factor EF-Tu and GTP, where codon-anticodon recognition triggers GTP hydrolysis and accommodation, followed by peptide bond formation and translocation catalyzed by elongation factor EF-G (EF-2 in eukaryotes) that shifts the ribosome one codon downstream. Translation terminates when a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) enters the A site and is recognized by release factors that hydrolyze the ester bond linking the completed polypeptide to the final tRNA. For example, polyribosomes, or polysomes, form when multiple ribosomes simultaneously translate a single mRNA, enabling a cell to produce many copies of a protein rapidly, as observed on the rough endoplasmic reticulum where membrane-bound polysomes synthesize secretory and transmembrane proteins co-translationally through the Sec61 translocon channel.
