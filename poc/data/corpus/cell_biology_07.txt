Cellular respiration is the metabolic process by which cells extract energy from organic molecules and convert it into adenosine triphosphate, the universal energy currency of biological systems. Glycolysis, occurring in the cytoplasm, converts one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate while generating a net yield of two ATP and two NADH molecules through substrate-level phosphorylation. Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex then catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA in the mitochondrial matrix, linking glycolysis to the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The citric acid cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle, processes acetyl-CoA through eight enzymatic steps that generate three NADH, one FADH2, one GTP, and two carbon dioxide molecules per turn. These reduced electron carriers donate their high-energy electrons to the electron transport chain embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where complexes I through IV perform sequential redox reactions that establish a proton gradient across the membrane. This electrochemical gradient, termed the proton-motive force, drives ATP synthase through rotary catalysis, coupling proton flux to the phosphorylation of ADP in a process known as oxidative phosphorylation. The chemiosmotic theory proposed by Peter Mitchell elegantly explains how the spatial separation of proton pumping and ATP synthesis enables efficient energy transduction. Under anaerobic conditions, cells resort to fermentation pathways that regenerate NAD+ through lactate dehydrogenase or alcohol dehydrogenase, sustaining glycolytic flux at the expense of energetic efficiency. Uncoupling proteins in brown adipose tissue dissipate the proton gradient as heat, demonstrating metabolic flexibility in thermogenesis.
