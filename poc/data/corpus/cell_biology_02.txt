The cytoskeleton provides structural support and facilitates intracellular transport. Microtubules are hollow polymers of tubulin that serve as tracks for motor proteins like kinesin and dynein. Actin filaments form a dense network beneath the plasma membrane called the cell cortex. Intermediate filaments provide mechanical strength and resist shearing forces within the cell.
