The cytoskeleton is a dynamic network of protein filaments that provides structural support, facilitates intracellular transport, and drives cell motility and division in eukaryotic cells. It comprises three principal components: microtubules, actin filaments (microfilaments), and intermediate filaments, each with distinct structural properties and functional roles. Microtubules are hollow cylindrical polymers assembled from alpha-tubulin and beta-tubulin heterodimers, exhibiting dynamic instability characterized by stochastic switching between phases of polymerization (rescue) and depolymerization (catastrophe) at their plus ends. These structures serve as tracks for the motor proteins kinesin, which moves cargo toward the plus end (anterograde transport), and cytoplasmic dynein, which transports cargo toward the minus end (retrograde transport) anchored at the centrosome or microtubule-organizing center. Actin filaments are helical polymers of globular actin monomers that form a dense meshwork beneath the plasma membrane called the cell cortex, generating protrusive forces for lamellipodia and filopodia during cell migration through Arp2/3 complex-mediated branched nucleation and formin-mediated linear elongation. Intermediate filaments, including vimentin in mesenchymal cells, keratins in epithelial cells, neurofilaments in neurons, and lamins lining the nuclear envelope, provide mechanical tensile strength and resist shearing forces without exhibiting the polarity-dependent dynamics of microtubules and actin. Cross-linking proteins such as plectin integrate all three filament systems into a cohesive mechanical framework. For example, during mitosis the cytoskeleton undergoes dramatic reorganization as interphase microtubule arrays disassemble and reassemble into the bipolar mitotic spindle, while the actin cortex generates contractile forces through myosin II activity to drive cytokinesis and physically separate daughter cells.
