Quantum bits or qubits exploit superposition to exist in multiple states simultaneously. Unlike classical bits limited to zero or one a qubit represents a linear combination of both states with complex probability amplitudes. Measurement collapses the superposition into a definite classical state. The Bloch sphere provides a geometric representation of single qubit states on a unit sphere.
