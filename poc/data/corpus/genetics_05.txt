CRISPR-Cas9 is a revolutionary genome editing technology derived from an adaptive immune system found in bacteria and archaea, where clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and their associated Cas proteins provide sequence-specific defense against invading bacteriophages and plasmids by storing fragments of foreign DNA as spacer sequences and using them to guide nuclease-mediated cleavage of matching sequences upon reinfection. The engineered CRISPR-Cas9 system consists of the Cas9 endonuclease from Streptococcus pyogenes complexed with a synthetic single guide RNA that combines the targeting function of the CRISPR RNA with the structural role of the trans-activating CRISPR RNA, directing Cas9 to any genomic locus complementary to a twenty-nucleotide guide sequence adjacent to a protospacer adjacent motif of the form NGG. Cas9 generates a blunt-ended double-strand break approximately three base pairs upstream of the PAM, which the cell repairs through either error-prone non-homologous end joining, frequently introducing insertions or deletions that disrupt gene function, or through homology-directed repair using an exogenous donor template to introduce precise sequence modifications including point mutations, insertions, or gene replacements. Advances beyond the original system include catalytically dead Cas9 fused to transcriptional activators or repressors for gene regulation without DNA cleavage, base editors that convert specific nucleotides without double-strand breaks, and prime editors that write new genetic information directly into target sites using a reverse transcriptase fused to a Cas9 nickase guided by a prime editing guide RNA. For example, clinical trials using ex vivo CRISPR-Cas9 editing of patient hematopoietic stem cells to disrupt the BCL11A erythroid enhancer have successfully reactivated fetal hemoglobin expression in individuals with sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of precise genome editing for monogenic blood disorders.
