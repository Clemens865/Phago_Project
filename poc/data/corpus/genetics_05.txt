CRISPR-Cas9 enables precise genome editing by creating targeted double-strand breaks in DNA. Guide RNA directs the Cas9 nuclease to complementary sequences in the genome. Homology-directed repair allows insertion of new genetic material at the cut site. Gene drives using CRISPR can propagate genetic modifications through populations at rates exceeding normal Mendelian inheritance.
