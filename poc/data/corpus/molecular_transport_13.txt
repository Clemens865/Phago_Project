Retrograde transport is the vesicular trafficking pathway that returns proteins, lipids, and membrane from distal compartments back to the endoplasmic reticulum and cis-Golgi, maintaining organelle homeostasis and ensuring the retrieval of escaped resident proteins. COPI-coated vesicles mediate the primary retrograde pathway from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum, with the heptameric coatomer complex recruited to Golgi membranes by the activated small GTPase ARF1, which is itself activated by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1. Endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins that escape to the Golgi are retrieved by the KDEL receptor ERD2, a seven-transmembrane protein that binds the carboxy-terminal KDEL retrieval motif in the low-pH environment of the cis-Golgi and releases its cargo upon return to the neutral pH of the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. The retromer complex, composed of the cargo-selective VPS26-VPS29-VPS35 trimer associated with sorting nexin dimers, mediates retrograde transport from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network, recycling the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor and Wntless, a sorting receptor for Wnt morphogen secretion. Toxins including Shiga toxin and cholera toxin exploit the retrograde transport pathway to reach the endoplasmic reticulum from the cell surface, traversing the endosomal system and Golgi apparatus in a retromer- and COPI-dependent manner before retrotranslocating to the cytosol to exert their toxic effects. The conserved oligomeric Golgi complex and the Golgi-associated retrograde protein complex facilitate intra-Golgi retrograde transport and Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum trafficking of glycosylation enzymes. Disruption of retrograde transport leads to Golgi fragmentation, accumulation of mislocalized proteins, and cellular dysfunction, with mutations in VPS35 linked to familial Parkinson disease through impaired retrograde trafficking of the autophagy receptor ATG9A.
