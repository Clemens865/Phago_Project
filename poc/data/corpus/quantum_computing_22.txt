Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are computational approaches that partition a problem between a quantum processor performing tasks intractable for classical computers and a classical computer managing optimization, error mitigation, and data processing, designed to extract useful quantum computation from noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. The variational quantum eigensolver and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm represent the archetypal hybrid algorithms, employing parameterized quantum circuits whose parameters are iteratively refined by a classical optimizer to minimize a cost function evaluated through quantum measurements. Quantum error mitigation techniques, distinct from quantum error correction, employ classical post-processing to reduce the impact of noise on quantum computation results without the overhead of encoding logical qubits in multiple physical qubits. Zero-noise extrapolation artificially amplifies the noise in a quantum circuit by stretching gate durations or inserting identity-equivalent noise-amplifying sequences, then extrapolates the measured expectation values to the zero-noise limit using polynomial or exponential fitting models. Probabilistic error cancellation decomposes the ideal noise-free operation as a quasi-probability distribution over implementable noisy operations, sampling from this distribution and weighting measurement outcomes by the quasi-probability signs to recover an unbiased estimate of the noise-free result at the cost of increased sampling overhead proportional to the one-norm of the quasi-probability representation. The quantum-classical feedback loop in hybrid algorithms introduces latency considerations, as each parameter update iteration requires quantum circuit execution, measurement, and classical optimization, with the total number of iterations and measurements per iteration determining the overall computational cost. Adaptive algorithms that dynamically grow the quantum circuit ansatz based on gradient information, exemplified by ADAPT-VQE, construct problem-tailored variational forms that converge with fewer parameters than fixed-structure ansatze. The integration of quantum subroutines into classical computational workflows through quantum cloud services enables hybrid algorithms to leverage the strengths of both quantum and classical resources.
