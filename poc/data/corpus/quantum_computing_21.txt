Quantum memory refers to physical systems capable of faithfully storing quantum information carried by photons or other quantum carriers for subsequent retrieval on demand, serving as an essential component of quantum repeaters, quantum networks, and linear optical quantum computing schemes. The performance of a quantum memory is characterized by several figures of merit including storage efficiency, defined as the probability that a stored photon is successfully retrieved; fidelity, measuring the overlap between the retrieved quantum state and the ideal state; storage time, the duration over which quantum coherence is preserved; bandwidth, the spectral width of photons that can be stored; and multimode capacity, the number of independent temporal or spectral modes that can be simultaneously stored. Atomic ensemble quantum memories based on warm alkali vapor cells or cold atom clouds employ the electromagnetic induced transparency protocol, in which a control laser creates a narrow transparency window in an absorbing medium through which a signal photon propagates at dramatically reduced group velocity before being converted to a stationary collective atomic excitation called a spin wave. The DLCZ protocol generates and stores entanglement between atomic ensembles and emitted photons through spontaneous Raman scattering, with the probabilistic but heralded nature of the entanglement enabling the construction of quantum repeater architectures. Solid-state quantum memories in rare-earth-ion-doped crystals such as europium-doped yttrium orthosilicate exploit the narrow homogeneous linewidths and long coherence times of the 4f electronic transitions, with the atomic frequency comb protocol achieving multimode storage by spectrally preparing a periodic absorption structure. Nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond provide quantum memory functionality through the long-lived nuclear spin states of nearby carbon-13 atoms, which can be coherently coupled to the electronic spin for storage and retrieval operations. Quantum memory efficiencies approaching unity have been demonstrated in cold atom systems, while storage times exceeding one hour have been achieved in rare-earth crystals, though combining high efficiency with long storage time in a single system remains a technological challenge.
