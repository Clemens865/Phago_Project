Cellular metabolism encompasses the entirety of biochemical reactions that sustain life, organized into interconnected anabolic and catabolic pathways regulated by allosteric enzymes, hormonal signals, and compartmentalization within organelles. The pentose phosphate pathway branches from glycolysis at glucose-6-phosphate, generating NADPH for reductive biosynthesis and ribose-5-phosphate for nucleotide synthesis, with the oxidative and non-oxidative branches serving distinct metabolic needs depending on cellular demands. Fatty acid oxidation in the mitochondrial matrix proceeds through iterative cycles of beta-oxidation, removing two-carbon units as acetyl-CoA while producing FADH2 and NADH that feed into the electron transport chain. Lipogenesis, catalyzed by fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, converts excess citrate-derived acetyl-CoA into palmitate in the cytosol, a process stimulated by insulin signaling and inhibited by AMP-activated protein kinase under energy deficit conditions. Amino acid catabolism involves transamination reactions catalyzed by aminotransferases that channel carbon skeletons into the citric acid cycle as alpha-ketoglutarate, oxaloacetate, fumarate, or succinyl-CoA. The urea cycle in hepatocytes detoxifies ammonia generated from amino acid deamination by converting it to urea for renal excretion, with carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I serving as the rate-limiting enzyme. Metabolic flux analysis using stable isotope tracers such as carbon-13-labeled glucose has revealed that cancer cells exhibit the Warburg effect, preferentially fermenting glucose to lactate even in the presence of oxygen, a metabolic reprogramming driven by oncogenic signaling through HIF-1alpha and MYC transcription factors. Metabolic compartmentalization between cytosol and mitochondria enables simultaneous operation of opposing pathways through shuttle systems including the malate-aspartate and glycerol-3-phosphate shuttles.
