Transposable elements, or transposons, are mobile genetic sequences that constitute approximately 45 percent of the human genome and have profoundly shaped genome evolution through their ability to replicate and insert at new genomic locations. Class I retrotransposons, including long interspersed nuclear elements and short interspersed nuclear elements, mobilize through an RNA intermediate that is reverse-transcribed into DNA by the encoded reverse transcriptase and integrase activities of the LINE-1 open reading frame 2 protein. LINE-1 elements, spanning approximately six kilobases, are the only autonomously active retrotransposons in the human genome, with an estimated 80 to 100 copies retaining transposition competence despite the vast majority being truncated or mutated. SINE elements, exemplified by the primate-specific Alu family numbering over one million copies, are non-autonomous retrotransposons that parasitize the LINE-1 enzymatic machinery for their mobilization. Class II DNA transposons move through a cut-and-paste mechanism catalyzed by transposase enzymes that excise the element from its donor site and integrate it at a target location, although most human DNA transposons have been inactive for approximately 37 million years. The host genome employs multiple defense mechanisms to suppress transposon activity, including DNA methylation of transposon sequences, histone H3K9 trimethylation by the SETDB1 methyltransferase, and the piRNA pathway in germline cells where PIWI-interacting RNAs guide the silencing of complementary transposon transcripts. Despite their parasitic nature, transposons have been co-opted for host functions, with the RAG1 recombinase mediating V(D)J recombination in adaptive immunity derived from an ancient transposase, and syncytin genes essential for placental development originating from endogenous retroviral envelope proteins.
