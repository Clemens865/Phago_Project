Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the major pathway for receptor-mediated internalization of extracellular macromolecules and transmembrane proteins from the plasma membrane, operating constitutively in all nucleated cells and accounting for the daily turnover of approximately one to two times the total plasma membrane area. The process initiates with the recruitment of the heterotetrameric adaptor protein complex AP-2 to the plasma membrane through cooperative interactions with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and tyrosine- or dileucine-based internalization motifs on cargo receptor cytoplasmic tails. Clathrin triskelia, composed of three heavy chains and three light chains arranged in a three-legged pinwheel, are recruited by AP-2 and polymerize into a polyhedral lattice that progressively invaginates the underlying membrane to form a clathrin-coated pit of approximately 100 nanometers in diameter. The GTPase dynamin assembles into helical oligomers around the neck of the deeply invaginated coated pit and undergoes GTP hydrolysis-driven conformational changes that constrict and sever the membrane neck, releasing the clathrin-coated vesicle into the cytoplasm. Accessory proteins regulate distinct stages of the pathway: FCHo proteins initiate pit nucleation, epsin inserts amphipathic helices to promote membrane curvature, intersectin coordinates with dynamin and the actin cytoskeleton, and auxilin and the ATPase HSC70 catalyze clathrin coat disassembly after vesicle internalization. The transferrin receptor represents the paradigmatic cargo of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, constitutively recycling through the endosomal system to deliver iron-loaded transferrin to acidic endosomes where iron is released, with the apo-transferrin-receptor complex returning to the cell surface. Low-density lipoprotein receptor internalization through clathrin-coated pits is essential for cholesterol homeostasis, with familial hypercholesterolemia caused by mutations that impair receptor endocytosis demonstrating the clinical importance of this transport pathway.
