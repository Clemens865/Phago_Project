Caveolae are specialized flask-shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane approximately 50 to 80 nanometers in diameter that mediate a clathrin-independent endocytic pathway and serve as signaling platforms, mechanosensors, and lipid reservoirs in many cell types. The formation of caveolae requires the structural protein caveolin-1 in non-muscle cells or caveolin-3 in striated muscle, which inserts into the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane as a hairpin-like integral membrane protein and oligomerizes to form the characteristic curved coat. Cavin proteins, particularly cavin-1/PTRF, are essential cytoplasmic components that stabilize caveolae at the cell surface by forming a polyhedral lattice around the caveolin coat, and their absence leads to the degradation of caveolin-1 and the loss of morphologically identifiable caveolae. Caveolar endocytosis is typically triggered by specific ligands including simian virus 40, cholera toxin B subunit, and albumin, and proceeds through a dynamin-dependent mechanism to deliver cargo to caveosomes, a specialized endosomal compartment that avoids the acidic environment of the classical endolysosomal pathway. In endothelial cells, caveolae mediate the transcytosis of albumin and other plasma proteins across the capillary wall, a process termed transcellular permeability that operates in parallel with paracellular transport through intercellular junctions. Caveolae function as membrane reservoirs that buffer mechanical stress by flattening upon membrane stretching, with this mechanosensory function being critical in tissues subject to mechanical strain including the cardiovascular system and skeletal muscle. Mutations in caveolin-3 cause a spectrum of muscle diseases including limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1C, rippling muscle disease, and familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, while loss of caveolin-1 in mice results in vascular dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiac hypertrophy.
