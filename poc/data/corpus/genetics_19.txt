Mitochondrial DNA is a circular double-stranded genome of approximately 16,569 base pairs in humans that encodes 13 polypeptides of the oxidative phosphorylation machinery, 22 transfer RNAs, and 2 ribosomal RNAs essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis. The mitochondrial genome exhibits several unique features including maternal inheritance, polyploidy with hundreds to thousands of copies per cell, a compact organization lacking introns, the use of a slightly modified genetic code, and a mutation rate approximately ten-fold higher than nuclear DNA due to proximity to reactive oxygen species generated by the electron transport chain and limited DNA repair capacity. Heteroplasmy, the coexistence of wild-type and mutant mitochondrial DNA molecules within a single cell, is a defining characteristic of mitochondrial genetics, with the proportion of mutant genomes determining phenotypic expression through a threshold effect that varies among tissues depending on their oxidative metabolic demands. The mitochondrial genetic bottleneck during oogenesis dramatically reduces the number of transmitted mitochondrial genomes, amplifying heteroplasmy shifts between generations and contributing to the variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance observed in mitochondrial diseases. Common mitochondrial DNA mutations include the 3243A-to-G transition in the tRNA-leucine gene causing mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes, and large-scale deletions causing progressive external ophthalmoplegia and Kearns-Sayre syndrome. Nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes, numbering over 1,500, are imported into mitochondria through the TOM and TIM translocase complexes, and mutations in these genes cause Mendelian mitochondrial disorders with autosomal inheritance patterns. Mitochondrial DNA haplogroups, defined by accumulated polymorphisms along maternal lineages, serve as molecular markers for tracing human migration patterns and population history across continents. Mitochondrial replacement therapy, including pronuclear transfer and maternal spindle transfer, aims to prevent transmission of pathogenic mitochondrial mutations by replacing the maternal mitochondrial complement with donor mitochondria.
