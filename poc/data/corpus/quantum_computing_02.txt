Quantum entanglement creates correlations between qubits that have no classical analogue. Bell states are maximally entangled two-qubit states used in quantum teleportation and superdense coding. Entanglement is a resource consumed by quantum algorithms and communication protocols. The EPR paradox and Bell inequality violations confirm that entanglement cannot be explained by hidden variable theories.
