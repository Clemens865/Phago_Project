Quantum entanglement is a uniquely quantum mechanical phenomenon in which two or more qubits become correlated in such a way that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently of the others, even when the particles are separated by arbitrarily large distances, a property Einstein famously characterized as spooky action at a distance. The four Bell states represent the maximally entangled two-qubit states: the Phi-plus and Phi-minus states are symmetric and antisymmetric superpositions of the ket-zero-zero and ket-one-one components, while the Psi-plus and Psi-minus states are superpositions of ket-zero-one and ket-one-zero, with the singlet state Psi-minus being the unique antisymmetric Bell state used in many quantum communication protocols. Entanglement is generated through controlled interactions between qubits, such as applying a Hadamard gate followed by a CNOT gate, and it serves as a consumable resource in quantum information protocols including quantum teleportation, where an unknown qubit state is transferred between distant parties using a shared Bell pair and two classical bits of communication, and superdense coding, where two classical bits are transmitted by sending a single entangled qubit. The EPR paradox proposed by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen in 1935 questioned whether quantum mechanics was complete, suggesting that hidden local variables might explain the observed correlations, but John Bell's 1964 inequality provided a testable criterion that local hidden variable theories must satisfy, and subsequent experiments by Alain Aspect and others decisively violated Bell's inequality, confirming the non-local character of entanglement. For example, quantum key distribution protocols such as BB84 and E91 exploit entanglement and the no-cloning theorem to enable provably secure communication, where any eavesdropping attempt necessarily disturbs the entangled state and introduces detectable errors in the shared key.
