Transcription is the first step of gene expression in which the nucleotide sequence of a DNA template strand is copied into a complementary messenger RNA molecule by the enzyme RNA polymerase, serving as the primary mechanism for converting genetic information stored in the genome into functional RNA products. In eukaryotes, RNA polymerase II is responsible for transcribing protein-coding genes, requiring the assembly of a pre-initiation complex at the promoter region where general transcription factors including TFIID, which contains the TATA-binding protein, TFIIB, TFIIF, TFIIE, and TFIIH position the polymerase and unwind approximately eleven base pairs of DNA to form the transcription bubble. Elongation proceeds as RNA polymerase II synthesizes the nascent pre-mRNA in the five-prime to three-prime direction at rates of approximately 20 to 40 nucleotides per second, with the carboxy-terminal domain of the largest polymerase subunit undergoing dynamic phosphorylation that recruits RNA processing factors for co-transcriptional modifications. The pre-mRNA undergoes three critical processing steps: addition of a seven-methylguanosine cap at the five-prime end by capping enzyme, which protects against exonuclease degradation and facilitates ribosome recruitment; removal of non-coding introns by the spliceosome, a dynamic ribonucleoprotein complex composed of five small nuclear RNAs and over 150 associated proteins that catalyzes two transesterification reactions; and cleavage followed by polyadenylation at the three-prime end, where poly-A polymerase adds a tail of approximately 200 adenine residues that enhances mRNA stability and nuclear export. Alternative splicing generates multiple mRNA isoforms from a single gene, dramatically expanding proteome diversity. For example, the Drosophila DSCAM gene can produce over 38,000 distinct mRNA variants through combinatorial alternative splicing of its 95 alternative exons, enabling individual neurons to express unique cell-surface receptor repertoires for self-avoidance during axon guidance.
