Topological qubits represent a fundamentally different approach to quantum information encoding that stores quantum states in the non-local topological properties of quasiparticle excitations called anyons, providing intrinsic protection against local noise sources that plague conventional qubit architectures. In two-dimensional topological phases of matter, anyon excitations obey neither bosonic nor fermionic exchange statistics but instead acquire non-trivial phase factors or undergo non-Abelian unitary transformations when braided around one another, with the computational space defined by the fusion channels of multiple anyons. Non-Abelian anyons, particularly Majorana zero modes predicted to exist at the ends of topological superconducting nanowires and in the fractional quantum Hall state at filling factor five-halves, support topological quantum computation where quantum gates are implemented by physically braiding the anyons along trajectories in space-time. The topological protection arises because the qubit state is encoded in the global fusion channel of spatially separated anyons rather than in any local degree of freedom, making it immune to local perturbations up to the energy gap of the topological phase. Microsoft's approach to topological quantum computing centers on engineering Majorana zero modes at the interface between semiconductor nanowires with strong spin-orbit coupling and conventional s-wave superconductors, with the topological phase transition controlled by an external magnetic field exceeding a critical value. The Fibonacci anyon model provides a theoretically universal platform for topological quantum computation, where braiding of Fibonacci anyons alone is sufficient to approximate any unitary transformation to arbitrary precision. Experimental progress toward topological qubits has included the observation of zero-bias conductance peaks consistent with Majorana signatures in semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures, although definitive demonstration of non-Abelian braiding statistics remains an outstanding challenge. The overhead of topological quantum error correction is expected to be dramatically lower than for conventional approaches, as the intrinsic error rate decreases exponentially with the separation between anyons.
