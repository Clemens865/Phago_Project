Lipid raft transport refers to the role of cholesterol- and sphingolipid-enriched membrane microdomains in organizing and facilitating the selective trafficking of proteins and lipids within the endomembrane system and at the plasma membrane. Lipid rafts, also termed detergent-resistant membranes due to their resistance to solubilization by non-ionic detergents at low temperature, are characterized by a liquid-ordered phase enriched in saturated sphingolipids and cholesterol that segregates from the surrounding liquid-disordered glycerophospholipid bilayer. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins preferentially partition into lipid rafts due to the saturated acyl chains of their lipid anchors, and this partitioning directs their apical sorting in polarized epithelial cells as they transit through the trans-Golgi network. Caveolae, a specialized subset of lipid rafts characterized by flask-shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane stabilized by the scaffolding protein caveolin-1, mediate the endocytosis of specific cargo including albumin, folate receptor, and cholera toxin through a dynamin-dependent mechanism. The formation of signaling platforms within lipid rafts concentrates receptor complexes and their downstream effectors, as exemplified by the clustering of T-cell receptors, LAT, and associated kinases in immunological synapse rafts during T-cell activation. Cholesterol depletion using methyl-beta-cyclodextrin disrupts lipid raft integrity and impairs raft-dependent signaling and trafficking processes, providing pharmacological evidence for the functional significance of these microdomains. In the biosynthetic pathway, sphingolipid and cholesterol sorting at the trans-Golgi network generates raft-enriched vesicles destined for the apical membrane in polarized cells, while non-raft lipids and proteins are directed to the basolateral surface. The concept of lipid rafts has been refined from static membrane structures to dynamic nanoscale assemblies that coalesce into larger platforms through protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions upon receptor crosslinking or cytoskeletal engagement.
