Gene regulation controls when and how much protein is produced from each gene. Transcription factors bind to enhancer and silencer regions to activate or repress gene expression. Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation alter chromatin accessibility without changing the DNA sequence. MicroRNAs provide post-transcriptional regulation by targeting messenger RNA for degradation.
