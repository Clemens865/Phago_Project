Quantum sensing exploits the extreme sensitivity of quantum systems to external perturbations to measure physical quantities including magnetic fields, electric fields, temperature, acceleration, and time with precision surpassing classical sensors by leveraging quantum phenomena such as superposition, entanglement, and squeezing. Nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond have emerged as versatile quantum sensors that detect nanoscale magnetic fields through the Zeeman splitting of their spin triplet ground state, enabling applications from single-molecule nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to mapping current flow in integrated circuits with spatial resolution below 100 nanometers. Atomic clocks, the most precise measurement instruments ever constructed, exploit the stable transition frequencies of atoms including cesium-133 for the definition of the second and strontium-87 and ytterbium-171 in optical lattice clocks achieving fractional frequency uncertainties below 10 to the negative 18, sufficient to detect gravitational redshift differences over centimeter height changes. Quantum magnetometers based on spin-exchange relaxation-free alkali vapor cells achieve subfemtotesla sensitivities rivaling superconducting quantum interference devices without requiring cryogenic operation, finding applications in magnetoencephalography for noninvasive brain imaging. Squeezed states of light, in which quantum noise is redistributed between conjugate quadratures to reduce fluctuations below the shot noise limit in the measured quadrature, enhance the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors including Advanced LIGO, which employs frequency-dependent squeezing to improve sensitivity across its detection bandwidth. Entanglement-enhanced sensing using GHZ states or spin-squeezed states enables measurement precision scaling at the Heisenberg limit of 1/N rather than the standard quantum limit of 1/sqrt(N) for N entangled particles, although maintaining entanglement in the presence of decoherence limits the practical advantage. Atom interferometers that split, redirect, and recombine atomic matter waves using laser pulses achieve extraordinary sensitivity to gravitational acceleration and rotation, with proposed space-based atom interferometers targeting the detection of gravitational waves in frequency bands inaccessible to optical interferometers.
