Synaptic vesicle recycling is the process by which neurotransmitter-containing vesicles are reformed, refilled, and repositioned at the active zone following exocytic fusion with the presynaptic plasma membrane, enabling sustained neurotransmission during periods of intense synaptic activity. The synaptic vesicle cycle begins with vesicle docking at the active zone, mediated by interactions between the vesicle protein Rab3 and the active zone scaffold protein RIM, followed by priming reactions involving Munc13 and Munc18 that render the SNARE complex fusion-competent. Following calcium-triggered exocytosis and neurotransmitter release, the vesicle membrane and its protein complement must be efficiently retrieved from the plasma membrane, a process accomplished through multiple endocytic pathways whose relative contributions depend on the level of synaptic stimulation. During low-frequency stimulation, kiss-and-run fusion allows the transient opening and rapid closure of a small fusion pore without full vesicle collapse into the plasma membrane, preserving vesicle identity and enabling rapid reuse within seconds. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis retrieves vesicle membrane over a timescale of tens of seconds following moderate stimulation, with the clathrin adaptor AP-2 and the accessory protein AP180 recognizing specific sorting motifs on synaptic vesicle proteins including synaptotagmin and VAMP2 to ensure the faithful reconstitution of vesicle protein composition. Ultrafast endocytosis, occurring within 50 to 100 milliseconds of exocytosis at physiological temperature, retrieves large endocytic vesicles from regions adjacent to the active zone in an actin- and dynamin-dependent manner, with subsequent clathrin-dependent budding from synaptic endosomes generating new synaptic vesicles. Activity-dependent bulk endocytosis operates during intense stimulation to internalize large portions of the presynaptic membrane as endosome-like cisternae from which new vesicles are subsequently budded through clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent mechanisms.
