Quantum random walks are the quantum mechanical analogue of classical random walks, in which a quantum walker evolves in superposition over the vertices of a graph with interference effects leading to qualitatively different spreading behavior compared to their classical counterparts. In the discrete-time quantum walk on a line, a coin operator acting on an internal degree of freedom of the walker creates a superposition of left and right moves at each step, and the resulting ballistic spreading with standard deviation proportional to the number of steps contrasts with the diffusive square-root scaling of the classical random walk. The continuous-time quantum walk is defined by the Schrodinger equation with the graph adjacency matrix or Laplacian serving as the Hamiltonian, producing a unitary evolution that can be viewed as the quantum analogue of a continuous-time Markov chain. Quantum walks on graphs have been shown to provide exponential speedups for certain problems, most notably the traversal of glued-tree graphs where the continuous-time quantum walk reaches the exit vertex in polynomial time while any classical algorithm requires exponential time. The quantum walk search algorithm, developed by analogy with Grover's search, achieves a quadratic speedup for searching marked vertices on various graph structures, with the optimal quantum speedup depending on the spectral properties of the graph Laplacian. Quantum walks form the computational basis for universal quantum computation, as any quantum circuit can be simulated by an appropriately designed quantum walk on a graph. Experimental implementations of quantum walks have been demonstrated in photonic waveguide arrays, trapped ion chains, superconducting qubit networks, and cold atom optical lattices. Applications of quantum walks extend to quantum simulation of physical systems including topological phases and Anderson localization, graph isomorphism testing, and the development of quantum algorithms for element distinctness and triangle finding with provable quantum speedups.
