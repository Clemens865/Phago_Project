Axonal transport is the bidirectional movement of proteins, organelles, mRNA, and signaling molecules along the axon between the neuronal cell body and synaptic terminals, a process essential for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of neurons whose axons can extend up to one meter in length. Fast anterograde transport, operating at velocities of 50 to 400 millimeters per day, delivers membrane-bound organelles including mitochondria, synaptic vesicle precursors, and dense core vesicles to the axon terminal, driven primarily by kinesin-1 and kinesin-3 family motors moving along axonal microtubules. Slow axonal transport, proceeding at 0.2 to 8 millimeters per day, conveys cytoskeletal elements including neurofilaments and tubulin as well as cytoplasmic proteins such as synapsin and clathrin through a mechanism involving intermittent rapid movements interspersed with prolonged pauses and occasional reversals. Fast retrograde transport, mediated predominantly by cytoplasmic dynein-dynactin complexes at velocities of 200 to 300 millimeters per day, returns signaling endosomes containing activated neurotrophic factor receptors, autophagosomes, and degradative compartments from the distal axon to the soma for transcriptional signaling and lysosomal degradation. The signaling endosome hypothesis proposes that nerve growth factor-TrkA receptor complexes internalized at axon terminals are retrogradely transported as intact signaling platforms that sustain MAPK and PI3K pathway activation throughout their journey to the cell body, where they activate transcription factors essential for neuronal survival. Mitochondrial transport and positioning along the axon are regulated by the Miro-Milton adaptor complex that links mitochondria to kinesin motors, with local calcium elevation causing Miro conformational changes that arrest mitochondrial movement at sites of high energy demand such as synapses and nodes of Ranvier. Disruption of axonal transport is a common pathogenic mechanism in neurodegenerative diseases, with mutations in motor proteins, adaptor complexes, and cytoskeletal components converging on transport deficits in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, Huntington disease, and hereditary spastic paraplegia.
