Transcytosis is the vesicular transport process by which macromolecules are shuttled across polarized cell barriers, including endothelial cells lining blood vessels and epithelial cells lining mucosal surfaces, by sequential endocytosis at one membrane domain and exocytosis at the opposing domain. In the neonatal intestinal epithelium, the neonatal Fc receptor FcRn mediates the transcytosis of maternal immunoglobulin G from breast milk across the intestinal barrier, binding IgG in the acidic environment of the intestinal lumen, trafficking through endosomal compartments, and releasing IgG at the neutral pH of the basolateral surface into the circulation. Polymeric immunoglobulin receptor-mediated transcytosis in mucosal epithelial cells transports dimeric IgA and pentameric IgM from the basolateral surface to the apical lumen, where proteolytic cleavage of the receptor releases secretory IgA bound to the secretory component that protects it from luminal proteases. In brain capillary endothelial cells, receptor-mediated transcytosis across the blood-brain barrier represents the primary entry route for essential molecules including transferrin-bound iron and insulin, and has been exploited as a strategy for brain drug delivery using bispecific antibodies targeting the transferrin receptor. Caveolae-mediated transcytosis of albumin across continuous endothelium, demonstrated by the presence of gold-labeled albumin within caveolar vesicles, contributes to the transport of albumin-bound fatty acids, hormones, and drugs from the vascular lumen to the interstitial space. The molecular regulation of transcytosis involves Rab GTPases including Rab11 and Rab25, the exocyst tethering complex, and SNARE proteins that direct vesicle fusion at the appropriate membrane domain. Disruption of transcytotic pathways has implications for disease, as increased transcytosis in inflamed endothelium contributes to edema formation, while reduced transcytosis of protective antibodies may compromise mucosal immunity.
