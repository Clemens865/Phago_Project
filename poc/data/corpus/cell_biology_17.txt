Tight junctions are specialized intercellular adhesion complexes located at the apicolateral border of polarized epithelial and endothelial cells that establish a selectively permeable paracellular barrier controlling the passage of ions, water, and solutes between adjacent cells. The transmembrane components of tight junctions include claudins, occludin, tricellulin, and junctional adhesion molecules, which form homotypic and heterotypic interactions in the intercellular cleft to create paired strands visible by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Claudins constitute a multigene family of over twenty-five members with tissue-specific expression patterns that determine the charge selectivity and size selectivity of the paracellular pathway, with claudin-2 forming cation-selective pores and claudin-4 functioning as a barrier-strengthening component. The cytoplasmic plaque of tight junctions contains scaffolding proteins of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase family, principally zonula occludens proteins ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3, which anchor transmembrane components to the perijunctional actomyosin ring. This actin cytoskeleton connection enables mechanical regulation of tight junction permeability through myosin light chain kinase-mediated contraction, a mechanism exploited by inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha to increase paracellular permeability during intestinal inflammation. Tight junctions also participate in signaling through recruitment of transcription factors, kinases, and phosphatases to the junctional complex, influencing cell proliferation and polarity. The blood-brain barrier exemplifies the most restrictive tight junction phenotype, with brain endothelial cells expressing high levels of claudin-5 to maintain neural homeostasis by excluding circulating toxins and immune cells from the central nervous system parenchyma.
