Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved catabolic mechanism through which cytoplasmic components including damaged organelles, protein aggregates, and intracellular pathogens are sequestered within double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes and delivered to lysosomes for degradation and recycling. The process is initiated when nutrient deprivation or cellular stress activates the ULK1 kinase complex, which phosphorylates beclin-1 and VPS34 to generate phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate on isolation membranes termed phagophores. Two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems, the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 complex and the LC3 lipidation machinery, drive phagophore elongation and closure, with LC3-II incorporation into autophagosomal membranes serving as a widely used marker of autophagic activity. The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 serves as the master negative regulator of autophagy, integrating signals from amino acid availability, growth factors, and energy status to suppress ULK1 activation under nutrient-replete conditions. Selective autophagy pathways employ cargo receptors such as p62/SQSTM1, NBR1, and OPTN that simultaneously bind ubiquitinated substrates and LC3 family members, ensuring specificity in substrate recognition. Mitophagy, the selective degradation of damaged mitochondria, is mediated by the PINK1-Parkin pathway, where PINK1 accumulation on depolarized mitochondria recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin to ubiquitinate outer membrane proteins. Defects in autophagy have been implicated in neurodegeneration, cancer, metabolic disorders, and aging, highlighting its fundamental importance in cellular quality control. The transcription factor TFEB coordinates the transcriptional program for lysosome biogenesis and autophagy gene expression in response to lysosomal nutrient sensing.
