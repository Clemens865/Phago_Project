Kinesin motor proteins are ATP-dependent molecular machines that transport cargo along microtubule tracks toward the plus end, which is typically oriented toward the cell periphery, playing essential roles in organelle positioning, vesicle trafficking, chromosome segregation, and ciliary function. Conventional kinesin, or kinesin-1, is a homodimeric protein in which two motor head domains connected by a coiled-coil stalk walk processively along the microtubule surface through a hand-over-hand mechanism, advancing 8 nanometers per ATP hydrolysis cycle corresponding to the spacing between adjacent tubulin dimers. The catalytic cycle of kinesin involves the coordinated alternation of nucleotide states in the two motor heads, with ATP binding to the leading head inducing a conformational change in the neck linker that swings the trailing head forward past the leading head in a process termed neck linker docking. Kinesin-1 transports a diverse array of cargo including mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum tubules, lysosomes, and mRNA ribonucleoprotein granules by engaging adaptor proteins and scaffolding complexes through its carboxy-terminal tail domain. The kinesin superfamily encompasses 45 genes in humans organized into 14 families with specialized functions: kinesin-2 drives intraflagellar transport essential for cilium assembly, kinesin-3 family members mediate fast axonal transport of synaptic vesicle precursors, kinesin-5 generates the outward sliding force that separates spindle poles during mitosis, and kinesin-13 family members depolymerize microtubules through a diffusion-and-capture mechanism rather than directed motility. Autoinhibition of kinesin-1 occurs when the cargo-free tail domain folds back to interact with the motor heads, preventing wasteful ATP consumption when the motor is not engaged with cargo. Post-translational modifications of tubulin, including acetylation and detyrosination, create a tubulin code that preferentially recruits specific kinesin motors to distinct microtubule populations.
