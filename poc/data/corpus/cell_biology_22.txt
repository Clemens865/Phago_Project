Peroxisomes are single-membrane-bound organelles found in virtually all eukaryotic cells that perform essential oxidative metabolic functions including the beta-oxidation of very long chain fatty acids, the synthesis of ether lipids and plasmalogens, and the detoxification of reactive oxygen species generated by their own oxidative enzymes. Peroxisomal matrix proteins are synthesized on free ribosomes in the cytosol and imported post-translationally through peroxisomal targeting signals recognized by the cycling receptor PEX5 for PTS1 or PEX7 for PTS2, which dock at the peroxisomal membrane through interactions with PEX13 and PEX14. The peroxisomal importomer is unique among protein translocation systems in its ability to transport folded and even oligomeric proteins across the membrane, with the receptor itself transiently inserted into the membrane before being recycled to the cytosol by the AAA-ATPases PEX1 and PEX6. Catalase, the most abundant peroxisomal enzyme, decomposes hydrogen peroxide generated by oxidases such as acyl-CoA oxidase and D-amino acid oxidase into water and molecular oxygen. In hepatocytes, peroxisomes perform the initial steps of bile acid synthesis through the action of dihydroxycoprostanoyl-CoA oxidase and cooperate with mitochondria in the oxidation of branched-chain fatty acids such as phytanic acid and pristanic acid. Peroxisome biogenesis disorders, including the lethal Zellweger syndrome spectrum caused by mutations in PEX genes, result in the absence of functional peroxisomes and accumulation of very long chain fatty acids, phytanic acid, and pipecolic acid. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, particularly PPARalpha, regulate peroxisomal gene expression in response to fibrate drugs and fatty acid ligands, linking peroxisomal metabolism to systemic lipid homeostasis.
