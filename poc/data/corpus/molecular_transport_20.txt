Pinocytosis, also termed fluid-phase endocytosis or cell drinking, is the non-selective internalization of extracellular fluid and dissolved solutes through the formation of small vesicles at the plasma membrane, a constitutive process occurring in virtually all eukaryotic cell types. Macropinocytosis represents a specialized form of pinocytosis in which actin-driven membrane ruffles extend from the cell surface and fold back to enclose large volumes of extracellular fluid in macropinosomes ranging from 0.2 to 5 micrometers in diameter. Growth factor stimulation, particularly through the epidermal growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor, activates Rac1 and CDC42 to promote the actin polymerization and membrane dynamics underlying macropinosome formation. In macrophages and dendritic cells, macropinocytosis operates constitutively and serves as a major pathway for antigen sampling, internalizing extracellular proteins for processing and presentation on major histocompatibility complex class II molecules to CD4-positive T lymphocytes. Cancer cells harboring oncogenic RAS mutations exhibit dramatically elevated macropinocytosis that is exploited as a nutrient acquisition pathway, with internalized extracellular proteins degraded in lysosomes to generate amino acids that sustain proliferation under nutrient-limited conditions. The molecular machinery of macropinocytosis shares components with phagocytosis including phosphoinositide 3-kinase, Rab5, and the WASH complex, but differs in its requirement for the Na-plus/H-plus exchanger NHE1, which generates the submembranous pH changes necessary for Rac1 activation at membrane ruffles. Following internalization, macropinosomes either mature through the endolysosomal pathway for content degradation or undergo tubulation and recycling to return membrane to the cell surface. The high throughput of pinocytic membrane trafficking necessitates efficient membrane recycling mechanisms to maintain plasma membrane area and lipid composition homeostasis.
