Stem cell differentiation is the process by which undifferentiated progenitor cells acquire specialized identities through the coordinated activation and silencing of lineage-specific gene programs. Embryonic stem cells derived from the inner cell mass of blastocysts possess pluripotency, the capacity to generate all cell types of the three germ layers, maintained by a core transcriptional circuitry involving OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG. These master regulators form autoregulatory loops and co-occupy the promoters of both actively transcribed pluripotency genes and poised developmental regulators marked by bivalent chromatin domains bearing both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 modifications. Upon induction of differentiation, signaling gradients of morphogens such as bone morphogenetic proteins, Wnt ligands, and fibroblast growth factors activate lineage-specific transcription factors that progressively restrict cellular potency. Induced pluripotent stem cells, generated by ectopic expression of Yamanaka factors OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and MYC, have revolutionized regenerative medicine by enabling patient-specific cell therapies without the ethical concerns associated with embryonic sources. Adult tissue-resident stem cells, including hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow niche and intestinal stem cells in the crypt base, maintain tissue homeostasis through asymmetric division that produces one self-renewing daughter and one committed progenitor. The stem cell niche provides critical microenvironmental cues through direct cell contact, paracrine signaling, and extracellular matrix composition that balance quiescence, self-renewal, and differentiation. Epigenetic reprogramming during differentiation involves DNA methylation, histone modification, and chromatin remodeling by SWI/SNF complexes that establish heritable transcriptional states defining cell identity.
