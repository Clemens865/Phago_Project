Neurotransmitter release is the calcium-dependent process by which synaptic vesicles fuse with the presynaptic plasma membrane to discharge their chemical contents into the synaptic cleft, enabling rapid signal transmission between neurons. Action potential propagation to the axon terminal activates voltage-gated calcium channels, predominantly P/Q-type and N-type channels, which are positioned in close proximity to docked synaptic vesicles at the active zone through interactions with the scaffolding proteins RIM and RIM-binding protein. The resulting microdomain of elevated calcium concentration is sensed by synaptotagmin-1, the principal calcium sensor for fast synchronous neurotransmitter release, which contains two C2 domains that bind calcium ions and insert into the plasma membrane to accelerate SNARE-mediated membrane fusion. The SNARE complex, composed of syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25 on the plasma membrane and synaptobrevin/VAMP2 on the synaptic vesicle, assembles into a four-helix bundle that draws the two membranes together and provides the mechanical force for lipid bilayer merger. Prior to calcium influx, the SNARE complex is held in a partially assembled primed state by the coordinated actions of Munc18-1 and Munc13, which together orchestrate the transition from syntaxin in its closed conformation to the fusion-competent open state. Complexin clamps the primed SNARE complex to prevent spontaneous fusion, with calcium-bound synaptotagmin displacing the complexin clamp to trigger synchronous release within a fraction of a millisecond. Following fusion pore opening and neurotransmitter discharge, synaptic vesicle membrane is retrieved through ultrafast endocytosis, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, or kiss-and-run fusion, depending on the level of synaptic activity. The vesicular neurotransmitter transporters, including VGLUT for glutamate, VGAT for GABA, and VAChT for acetylcholine, refill recycled vesicles using the proton electrochemical gradient established by the vacuolar ATPase.
