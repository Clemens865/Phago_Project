DNA replication is the semiconservative process by which a cell duplicates its entire genome prior to cell division, ensuring that each daughter cell receives a complete and faithful copy of the genetic information encoded in the double-helical structure of deoxyribonucleic acid. Replication initiates at specific chromosomal loci called origins of replication, where the origin recognition complex and helicase loaders recruit the MCM helicase to unwind the parental duplex, creating a replication fork with two single-stranded DNA templates stabilized by single-strand binding proteins such as RPA. DNA polymerase III in prokaryotes, or DNA polymerases epsilon and delta in eukaryotes, synthesize new complementary strands exclusively in the five-prime to three-prime direction, necessitating the continuous synthesis of the leading strand and the discontinuous synthesis of the lagging strand as short Okazaki fragments of approximately 100 to 200 nucleotides in eukaryotes, each initiated by an RNA primer synthesized by the primase component of the DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex. The intrinsic three-prime to five-prime proofreading exonuclease activity of replicative polymerases achieves an error rate of approximately one mistake per ten million nucleotides, which is further improved to roughly one error per billion base pairs by the post-replicative mismatch repair system involving MutS homologs that scan newly synthesized DNA for base-pairing errors. Topoisomerases relieve the torsional strain ahead of the replication fork by transiently breaking and rejoining DNA strands, while DNA ligase seals the nicks between Okazaki fragments to produce continuous daughter strands. For example, in rapidly dividing human cells, the simultaneous activation of tens of thousands of replication origins across all chromosomes enables the complete duplication of over six billion base pairs within approximately eight hours of S phase, with telomerase extending the repetitive TTAGGG sequences at chromosome ends to counteract the end-replication problem.
