The centrosome is the primary microtubule-organizing center in animal cells, consisting of a pair of orthogonally arranged centrioles surrounded by a proteinaceous matrix called the pericentriolar material from which microtubules are nucleated. Each centriole is a barrel-shaped structure composed of nine triplets of microtubules arranged in a cartwheel configuration stabilized by the scaffolding protein SAS-6, which self-assembles into a ninefold-symmetric oligomer that templates centriole geometry. Centrosome duplication occurs once per cell cycle during S phase, initiated by the phosphorylation of NPAT by CDK2-cyclin E and the recruitment of PLK4 kinase, the master regulator of centriole biogenesis, to the proximal end of each existing centriole. The pericentriolar material contains gamma-tubulin ring complexes that serve as templates for microtubule nucleation, with pericentrin and CDK5RAP2 anchoring these complexes within the pericentriolar matrix. During mitosis, centrosome maturation involves the recruitment of additional pericentriolar material through Aurora A kinase-dependent phosphorylation, increasing microtubule nucleation capacity to form the bipolar mitotic spindle. The mother centriole is distinguished from the daughter by the presence of distal and subdistal appendages that anchor microtubules and dock at the plasma membrane to template primary cilium formation during quiescence. Centrosome amplification, resulting in supernumerary centrosomes, is a hallmark of many cancers and promotes chromosomal instability through multipolar spindle formation, although cancer cells frequently cluster extra centrosomes to achieve pseudo-bipolar division. Mutations in centrosomal proteins including CEP152, CEP135, and CPAP cause autosomal recessive primary microcephaly, linking centrosome function to brain development and neural progenitor proliferation.
