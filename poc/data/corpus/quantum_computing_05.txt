Quantum error correction protects quantum information from decoherence and gate errors. The surface code encodes logical qubits in two-dimensional arrays of physical qubits with nearest-neighbor interactions. Topological quantum computing uses anyonic braiding to perform fault-tolerant operations. Current noisy intermediate-scale quantum processors have fifty to several hundred qubits but lack full error correction capability.
