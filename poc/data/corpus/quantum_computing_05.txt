Quantum error correction is a set of techniques for protecting fragile quantum information from the inevitable noise introduced by decoherence, gate imperfections, and measurement errors, addressing the fundamental challenge that quantum states cannot be copied due to the no-cloning theorem and that direct measurement destroys superposition. Quantum error-correcting codes encode a single logical qubit into an entangled state of multiple physical qubits, enabling the detection and correction of errors without directly measuring the encoded quantum information, instead using ancilla qubits to extract error syndromes that identify which type of error occurred and on which qubit. The surface code is the leading candidate for scalable quantum error correction, encoding logical qubits in a two-dimensional lattice of physical qubits with only nearest-neighbor interactions, where stabilizer measurements on plaquettes and vertices detect bit-flip and phase-flip errors respectively, and a minimum-weight perfect matching decoder identifies the most likely error chain. The error threshold of the surface code is approximately one percent per physical gate operation, meaning that if individual qubit gate fidelities exceed ninety-nine percent, adding more physical qubits monotonically suppresses the logical error rate, though the overhead is substantial, requiring on the order of one thousand physical qubits per logical qubit for practically useful error suppression. Alternative approaches include topological quantum computing, which proposes to encode information in the braiding trajectories of non-Abelian anyons such as Majorana zero modes in topological superconductors, providing inherent protection against local perturbations through the topological degeneracy of the ground state. Concatenated codes, color codes, and recently discovered quantum low-density parity-check codes offer different trade-offs between threshold, overhead, and connectivity requirements. For example, recent experiments on superconducting quantum processors have demonstrated that increasing the surface code distance from three to five reduces the logical error rate, providing the first below-threshold demonstration that adding physical qubits genuinely improves logical qubit performance and validating the practical viability of the surface code architecture for future fault-tolerant quantum computation.
