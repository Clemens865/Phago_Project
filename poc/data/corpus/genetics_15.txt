Alternative splicing is a fundamental mechanism of gene regulation that enables a single gene to encode multiple protein isoforms through the differential inclusion or exclusion of exons and the selection of alternative splice sites during pre-mRNA processing. The spliceosome, a large ribonucleoprotein machine composed of five small nuclear RNAs and over 150 associated proteins, catalyzes the two transesterification reactions that excise introns and ligate exons through a mechanism involving lariat intermediate formation. Alternative splicing events are classified into several categories including cassette exon skipping, the most prevalent form in vertebrates, as well as alternative 5-prime and 3-prime splice site selection, intron retention, and mutually exclusive exon usage. Splicing regulatory elements, classified as exonic or intronic splicing enhancers and silencers, recruit trans-acting factors that modulate splice site recognition by the spliceosome. Serine/arginine-rich proteins bind exonic splicing enhancers to promote inclusion of adjacent exons through recruitment of U1 snRNP to the upstream 5-prime splice site and U2AF to the downstream 3-prime splice site. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, including hnRNP A1 and PTBP1, generally function as splicing repressors by binding silencer elements and blocking spliceosome assembly. The combinatorial action of multiple RNA-binding proteins creates tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific splicing programs, with the RBFOX, NOVA, and MBNL families governing neuron-specific splicing patterns. High-throughput RNA sequencing has revealed that over 95 percent of human multi-exon genes undergo alternative splicing, vastly expanding the proteomic diversity encoded by the approximately 20,000 protein-coding genes. Aberrant splicing caused by mutations in splice sites, regulatory elements, or splicing factors underlies numerous human diseases including spinal muscular atrophy, myotonic dystrophy, and various cancers.
