Single nucleotide polymorphisms represent the most abundant form of genetic variation in the human genome, occurring approximately once every 300 base pairs and numbering over 600 million cataloged variants across diverse human populations. SNPs arise from point mutations in which a single nucleotide is substituted by another, with transitions between purines or between pyrimidines occurring approximately twice as frequently as transversions between a purine and a pyrimidine due to the molecular mechanisms of spontaneous deamination and tautomeric shifts. The functional consequences of SNPs depend critically on their genomic context, with synonymous SNPs in coding regions typically considered neutral, nonsynonymous missense SNPs potentially altering protein structure and function, and regulatory SNPs in promoters, enhancers, and untranslated regions modulating gene expression levels. Genome-wide association studies employ high-density SNP genotyping arrays containing millions of tag SNPs that capture common variation through linkage disequilibrium, enabling the identification of susceptibility loci for complex diseases and quantitative traits at genome-wide significance thresholds. The International HapMap Project and the 1000 Genomes Project have cataloged patterns of linkage disequilibrium and haplotype structure across diverse populations, revealing that most common variation is shared among continental groups while population-specific variants reflect demographic history and local adaptation. Pharmacogenomic SNPs in drug-metabolizing enzymes including CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 influence individual responses to medications, with poor metabolizer and ultra-rapid metabolizer phenotypes requiring dose adjustments for drugs including warfarin, clopidogrel, and codeine. Expression quantitative trait loci mapping has revealed that the majority of disease-associated SNPs identified by genome-wide association studies act through regulatory mechanisms that alter transcript abundance rather than protein coding sequence, highlighting the importance of non-coding variation in complex trait architecture.
