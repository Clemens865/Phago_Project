ATP-binding cassette transporters constitute one of the largest and most ancient protein superfamilies, utilizing the energy of ATP hydrolysis to translocate a diverse array of substrates including ions, lipids, peptides, drugs, and metabolites across biological membranes. The canonical ABC transporter architecture comprises two transmembrane domains that form the translocation pathway and two nucleotide-binding domains that hydrolyze ATP, arranged as either a full transporter in a single polypeptide or a half transporter requiring homodimerization or heterodimerization. The transport cycle follows an alternating access mechanism in which ATP binding to the nucleotide-binding domains induces their dimerization and a conformational switch from the inward-facing to the outward-facing state, opening the substrate-binding cavity to the extracellular space, while ATP hydrolysis and phosphate release reset the transporter to the inward-facing conformation. P-glycoprotein, encoded by the ABCB1 gene, is the prototypical multidrug resistance transporter that extrudes a broad spectrum of hydrophobic compounds from the cell, including chemotherapeutic agents, and its overexpression in tumor cells represents a major obstacle in cancer pharmacotherapy. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, ABCC7, is unique among ABC transporters in functioning as a chloride and bicarbonate channel rather than a pump, with the regulatory domain requiring phosphorylation by protein kinase A for channel activation. ABCA1 mediates the efflux of cholesterol and phospholipids to apolipoprotein A-I acceptors in the first step of reverse cholesterol transport, and loss-of-function mutations cause Tangier disease characterized by the near absence of high-density lipoprotein and cholesterol accumulation in macrophages. The ABCG5/ABCG8 heterodimer in hepatocytes and enterocytes limits intestinal absorption and promotes biliary excretion of plant sterols, with mutations causing sitosterolemia and premature atherosclerosis.
