Trapped ion quantum computing encodes quantum information in the electronic states of individual atomic ions confined in electromagnetic traps, leveraging the identical nature of atomic systems and their long coherence times to achieve some of the highest-fidelity quantum operations demonstrated to date. Linear Paul traps confine strings of ions using oscillating radiofrequency electric fields that create an effective harmonic pseudopotential, with laser-cooled ions crystallizing into one-dimensional chains where the inter-ion spacing of several micrometers enables individual optical addressing. Qubits are encoded either in hyperfine ground states of ions such as ytterbium-171 and barium-133, which exhibit coherence times exceeding minutes, or in optical transitions of ions such as calcium-40, which offer fast gate speeds through direct laser-driven transitions. Single-qubit gates are performed by applying resonant microwave or laser fields that drive coherent Rabi oscillations between the qubit states, with composite pulse sequences correcting for systematic errors to achieve fidelities above 99.99 percent. The Molmer-Sorensen entangling gate creates pairwise entanglement between ions by driving motional sidebands with bichromatic laser fields that couple the qubits through their shared motional modes, achieving two-qubit gate fidelities above 99.9 percent in leading experiments. Scaling trapped ion systems beyond tens of qubits is pursued through quantum charge-coupled device architectures that shuttle ions between trapping zones using segmented electrode arrays, photonic interconnects that distribute entanglement between separate trapping modules through photon-mediated ion-ion entanglement, and two-dimensional ion trap arrays. Quantinuum and IonQ represent the commercial leaders in trapped ion quantum computing, with Quantinuum's System Model H2 demonstrating 56 fully connected qubits with all-to-all connectivity and record quantum volume benchmarks. The native all-to-all connectivity of trapped ion systems eliminates the overhead of SWAP gates required for nearest-neighbor architectures, reducing circuit depth for many quantum algorithms.
