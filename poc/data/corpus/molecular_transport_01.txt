Active transport is the energy-dependent movement of molecules and ions across biological membranes against their electrochemical concentration gradient, a thermodynamically unfavorable process that requires coupling to an exergonic energy source such as ATP hydrolysis, light absorption, or the dissipation of a co-transported ion gradient. The sodium-potassium ATPase, or Na+/K+ pump, is the paradigmatic primary active transporter, a P-type ATPase that hydrolyzes one molecule of ATP to export three sodium ions from the cytoplasm and import two potassium ions from the extracellular space through a series of conformational changes between E1 and E2 states involving a phosphorylated aspartate intermediate. This electrogenic pump generates a net negative charge inside the cell, establishing the resting membrane potential of approximately negative seventy millivolts critical for neuronal excitability, cardiac pacemaker activity, and epithelial solute reabsorption. Secondary active transport, or co-transport, harnesses the sodium gradient established by the Na+/K+ pump to drive the uptake of glucose via the SGLT1 symporter in intestinal epithelial cells or the extrusion of calcium ions via the sodium-calcium exchanger in cardiac myocytes. The V-type ATPases found in lysosomal and endosomal membranes pump protons into the lumen to maintain the acidic pH required for hydrolase activity, while the F-type ATP synthase in mitochondria operates in reverse, using the proton-motive force to synthesize ATP. ABC transporters, including the multidrug resistance protein P-glycoprotein, use ATP hydrolysis to efflux hydrophobic substrates across membranes. For example, in renal proximal tubule cells, the coordinated activity of basolateral Na+/K+ ATPase and apical sodium-glucose cotransporters enables the reclamation of virtually all filtered glucose from the glomerular filtrate, illustrating how primary and secondary active transport systems cooperate to achieve directional solute movement across polarized epithelia.
