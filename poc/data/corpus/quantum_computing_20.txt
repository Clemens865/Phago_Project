Quantum compilers are software systems that transform high-level quantum algorithms expressed in terms of abstract quantum gates into executable sequences of native operations compatible with the constraints of a specific quantum hardware platform. The compilation pipeline typically includes circuit optimization to reduce gate count and depth, qubit mapping to assign logical qubits to physical qubits respecting hardware connectivity constraints, and gate synthesis to decompose arbitrary unitary operations into sequences of native gates from the hardware's instruction set. The Solovay-Kitaev theorem guarantees that any single-qubit unitary can be approximated to precision epsilon using a sequence of gates from a universal gate set with length scaling as O(log^c(1/epsilon)), where c is approximately 3.97, providing a theoretical foundation for efficient gate decomposition. Qubit routing algorithms, including SABRE and the noise-adaptive routing framework, insert SWAP gates to move quantum information between non-adjacent qubits on the hardware's coupling graph, with the optimization objective of minimizing the total circuit depth or error rate. Peephole optimization identifies and simplifies small subcircuits by matching patterns such as adjacent inverse gates, commuting gates that can be reordered, and gate cancellations that reduce the total gate count without altering the computed unitary transformation. Template-based optimization uses a library of circuit identities to replace expensive subcircuits with equivalent but lower-cost implementations, with templates discovered through automated search or derived from algebraic relationships between quantum gates. Noise-aware compilation incorporates the calibration data of individual qubits and gate error rates into the optimization process, preferentially routing critical operations through the highest-fidelity qubits and gates. Quantum compilation frameworks including Qiskit's transpiler, Google's Cirq, and the TKET compiler from Quantinuum implement these algorithms and expose multiple optimization levels allowing users to trade compilation time for circuit quality.
