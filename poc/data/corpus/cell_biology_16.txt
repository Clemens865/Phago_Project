Cellular senescence is an irreversible state of proliferative arrest triggered by various genotoxic stresses including telomere erosion, oncogene activation, oxidative damage, and persistent DNA double-strand breaks. The senescence program is enforced by two major tumor suppressor pathways converging on the retinoblastoma protein: the p53-p21 axis, which responds to DNA damage checkpoint signaling through ATM and CHK2 kinases, and the p16INK4a-CDK4/6-Rb pathway, which accumulates during prolonged replicative stress and oncogene-induced senescence. Senescent cells undergo dramatic morphological changes including cell enlargement, flattening, and increased lysosomal content manifested as senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity. The senescence-associated secretory phenotype represents a complex paracrine program through which senescent cells secrete inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 and interleukin-8, matrix metalloproteinases, growth factors, and chemokines that profoundly alter the tissue microenvironment. This secretory phenotype recruits immune cells for senescent cell clearance but can also promote chronic inflammation, tissue dysfunction, and paradoxically stimulate proliferation of neighboring pre-malignant cells. Oncogene-induced senescence serves as a potent tumor-suppressive barrier, exemplified by BRAF-V600E-induced senescence in melanocytic nevi that prevents progression to melanoma. Accumulation of senescent cells during aging contributes to age-related pathologies including atherosclerosis, osteoarthritis, and pulmonary fibrosis. Senolytic drugs, including the dasatinib plus quercetin combination and navitoclax, selectively eliminate senescent cells by targeting anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members upon which senescent cells depend for survival. The emerging field of senolytics holds therapeutic promise for extending healthspan by reducing the senescent cell burden in aged tissues.
