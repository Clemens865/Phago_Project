Protein folding is the physical process by which a polypeptide chain acquires its functional three-dimensional conformation, guided by the thermodynamic principle that the native state represents the global free energy minimum on a rugged energy landscape. The folding funnel model describes how an unfolded protein progressively collapses through an ensemble of partially folded intermediates, driven by hydrophobic collapse and the burial of nonpolar residues in the protein interior. Molecular chaperones such as the HSP70 and HSP60 families play essential roles in assisting nascent polypeptides to reach their native conformations by preventing aggregation and providing a protected folding environment. The GroEL-GroES chaperonin system in bacteria encapsulates substrate proteins within its central cavity, where iterative cycles of ATP hydrolysis drive conformational changes that promote productive folding. In the endoplasmic reticulum, protein disulfide isomerase catalyzes the formation and rearrangement of disulfide bonds, while calnexin and calreticulin serve as lectin chaperones that monitor the glycosylation status of nascent glycoproteins. Misfolded proteins are targeted for degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system or endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway, which recognizes aberrant conformations through exposed hydrophobic patches. When quality control mechanisms fail, misfolded proteins can aggregate into amyloid fibrils characterized by cross-beta sheet architecture, a pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and prion encephalopathies. The unfolded protein response activates transcription factors ATF6, IRE1, and PERK to upregulate chaperone expression and attenuate translation when proteostatic stress overwhelms the folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum.
