Membrane trafficking is the vesicle-mediated transport system that maintains the distinct composition of intracellular compartments while enabling the dynamic exchange of lipids, proteins, and cargo molecules between organelles. The secretory pathway begins at the endoplasmic reticulum, where newly synthesized proteins are co-translationally translocated through the Sec61 translocon, folded with the assistance of resident chaperones, and packaged into COPII-coated vesicles at endoplasmic reticulum exit sites for transport to the Golgi apparatus. COPII coat assembly is initiated by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sec12, which activates the small GTPase Sar1 to recruit the inner coat complex Sec23-Sec24 and the outer coat complex Sec13-Sec31, generating vesicles of 60 to 90 nanometers in diameter. Retrograde transport from the Golgi back to the endoplasmic reticulum employs COPI-coated vesicles that retrieve escaped resident proteins bearing KDEL retrieval signals recognized by the KDEL receptor ERD2. Within the Golgi stack, cargo progresses through cis, medial, and trans cisternae where sequential glycosylation and processing reactions occur, with the cisternal maturation model proposing that Golgi cisternae themselves progress while retrograde vesicles recycle processing enzymes. At the trans-Golgi network, cargo is sorted into distinct transport carriers destined for the plasma membrane, endosomes, or lysosomes, with mannose-6-phosphate receptors directing lysosomal hydrolases to the endolysosomal pathway. Rab GTPases, tethering factors, and SNARE complexes ensure the fidelity of vesicle targeting and fusion at each transport step, with the energy of SNARE complex assembly driving membrane merger and NSF-mediated disassembly recycling SNAREs for subsequent rounds of fusion.
