Shor's algorithm is a quantum algorithm discovered by Peter Shor in 1994 that factors large composite integers into their prime components in polynomial time, specifically in O of log-N cubed operations, representing an exponential speedup over the best known classical factoring algorithms such as the general number field sieve which requires sub-exponential time. The algorithm operates in two stages: a classical reduction that transforms the factoring problem into the problem of finding the period of a modular exponentiation function, and a quantum subroutine that uses the quantum Fourier transform to efficiently extract this period from a superposition of function values evaluated in parallel across exponentially many inputs. The quantum Fourier transform maps computational basis states to Fourier basis states through a sequence of Hadamard gates and controlled phase rotation gates, and its ability to detect periodicity in quantum-encoded functions is the source of the exponential advantage, as classical algorithms cannot efficiently sample from the Fourier spectrum of exponentially large functions. The cryptographic implications are profound because RSA public-key encryption, which secures the majority of internet communications, relies on the computational intractability of factoring the product of two large primes, typically of 2048 or 4096 bits, and a sufficiently large fault-tolerant quantum computer running Shor's algorithm could break RSA in hours rather than the billions of years required classically. Beyond factoring, Shor's algorithm also efficiently solves the discrete logarithm problem, threatening elliptic curve cryptography and Diffie-Hellman key exchange, motivating the development of post-quantum cryptographic schemes based on lattice problems, hash functions, and coding theory. For example, current estimates suggest that factoring a 2048-bit RSA key would require a quantum computer with approximately twenty million physical qubits using surface code error correction, a scale that remains beyond present hardware but drives the urgency of the ongoing transition to quantum-resistant cryptographic standards.
