Shor's algorithm factors large integers in polynomial time using quantum Fourier transform. This threatens RSA encryption which relies on the computational difficulty of integer factorization. Grover's algorithm provides quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems. Quantum approximate optimization algorithm solves combinatorial optimization problems on near-term quantum hardware.
