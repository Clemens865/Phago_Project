Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon in which certain genes are expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner, with one parental allele being silenced through DNA methylation and histone modifications established during gametogenesis. Approximately 150 imprinted genes have been identified in the mammalian genome, many clustered in chromosomal domains regulated by imprinting control regions that acquire differential methylation marks in the male and female germlines. The imprinting control region at the IGF2-H19 locus on chromosome 11p15.5 exemplifies the insulator model of imprinting, where the unmethylated maternal allele binds the zinc finger protein CTCF, creating a chromatin insulator that blocks IGF2 promoter access to downstream enhancers and permits H19 transcription, while paternal methylation prevents CTCF binding and allows IGF2 expression. The parental conflict hypothesis, proposed by David Haig, provides an evolutionary framework for genomic imprinting, positing that paternally expressed imprinted genes tend to promote embryonic growth to maximize paternal reproductive success, while maternally expressed genes restrain growth to preserve maternal resources for future offspring. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, characterized by macrosomia, organomegaly, and predisposition to embryonal tumors, results from disruption of imprinting at chromosome 11p15.5 through various mechanisms including loss of methylation at the KCNQ1OT1 imprinting center, paternal uniparental disomy, or gain of methylation at the H19 locus. Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome represent paradigmatic imprinting disorders caused by deletion or dysfunction of imprinted genes at chromosome 15q11-q13, with paternal deletions causing Prader-Willi syndrome and maternal deletions causing Angelman syndrome due to the reciprocal silencing of genes in this domain.
