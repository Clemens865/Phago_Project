Recombinant DNA technology encompasses the set of molecular biology techniques used to create novel combinations of genetic material by joining DNA fragments from different sources and propagating them in host organisms. Restriction endonucleases, discovered in bacteria as defense mechanisms against bacteriophage infection, cleave DNA at specific palindromic recognition sequences to generate defined fragments with either sticky ends or blunt ends that can be joined to similarly cut vector DNA by DNA ligase. Plasmid vectors, derived from naturally occurring bacterial episomes, contain essential features including an origin of replication for autonomous propagation, a selectable marker such as antibiotic resistance for identifying transformed clones, and a multiple cloning site containing unique restriction enzyme recognition sequences for inserting foreign DNA. Expression vectors additionally incorporate strong promoters, ribosome binding sites, and transcription terminators to drive high-level transcription and translation of cloned genes in the host organism. The polymerase chain reaction, invented by Kary Mullis, enables exponential amplification of specific DNA sequences through iterative cycles of denaturation, primer annealing, and extension by a thermostable DNA polymerase, generating billions of copies from minute starting material within hours. Gateway and Gibson assembly cloning strategies have streamlined the construction of complex multi-fragment assemblies through recombinase-mediated or isothermal overlap-based joining reactions that eliminate the need for restriction enzyme digestion and ligation. Bacterial artificial chromosomes and yeast artificial chromosomes accommodate large DNA inserts of 100 to 300 kilobases and over one megabase, respectively, enabling the cloning and manipulation of entire genomic regions. Site-directed mutagenesis techniques allow the precise introduction of point mutations, insertions, or deletions into cloned sequences, facilitating structure-function studies of proteins and regulatory elements through systematic alteration of specific residues or nucleotides.
