Cellular adhesion molecules are transmembrane glycoproteins that mediate cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions essential for tissue integrity, morphogenesis, and immune surveillance. Cadherins constitute a major family of calcium-dependent adhesion molecules, with E-cadherin predominating in epithelial tissues and N-cadherin in neural and mesenchymal cells. Classical cadherins form homophilic trans-interactions through their extracellular cadherin repeats, while their cytoplasmic domains associate with catenin complexes that link to the actin cytoskeleton. Beta-catenin serves a dual role as both a structural adaptor at adherens junctions and a transcriptional coactivator in the Wnt signaling pathway, connecting adhesion to gene regulation. Integrins are heterodimeric receptors composed of alpha and beta subunits that mediate bidirectional signaling between the extracellular matrix and the cell interior, a process termed outside-in and inside-out signaling. Focal adhesion kinase and integrin-linked kinase transduce mechanical forces sensed at integrin clusters into biochemical signals that regulate cell survival, migration, and proliferation. The immunoglobulin superfamily of adhesion molecules, including ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and NCAM, participate in leukocyte trafficking and neural development through heterophilic interactions with integrins and other counter-receptors. Selectins, comprising L-selectin, P-selectin, and E-selectin, mediate the initial tethering and rolling of leukocytes on activated endothelium through transient interactions with sialylated and fucosylated glycan ligands such as PSGL-1. Loss of adhesion molecule expression or function contributes to epithelial-mesenchymal transition, a process central to cancer metastasis and embryonic development.
