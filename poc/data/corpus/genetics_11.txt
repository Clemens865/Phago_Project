Telomere maintenance is essential for chromosomal stability and cellular replicative capacity, as telomeres are specialized nucleoprotein structures at chromosome termini composed of tandem TTAGGG repeats in vertebrates that protect linear chromosomes from degradation, end-to-end fusion, and recognition as DNA damage. The end replication problem, arising from the inability of conventional DNA polymerases to fully replicate the 3-prime end of linear chromosomes, results in progressive telomere shortening of 50 to 200 base pairs per cell division in human somatic cells. Telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein enzyme comprising the reverse transcriptase catalytic subunit TERT and the RNA template component TERC, counteracts telomere attrition by adding telomeric repeats to chromosome ends using its integral RNA template. Telomerase expression is restricted in most human somatic tissues but is reactivated in approximately 85 percent of cancers, enabling unlimited replicative potential, while the remaining cancers maintain telomeres through the recombination-based alternative lengthening of telomeres pathway. The shelterin complex, composed of six proteins including TRF1, TRF2, POT1, TIN2, TPP1, and RAP1, caps telomeric DNA and prevents the activation of DNA damage response pathways at chromosome termini. TRF2 facilitates the formation of t-loop structures in which the 3-prime single-stranded overhang invades the double-stranded telomeric region, sequestering the chromosome end from recognition by ATM kinase. POT1 binds the single-stranded telomeric overhang and suppresses ATR-mediated checkpoint activation. Telomere dysfunction, whether through critical shortening or shelterin disruption, triggers replicative senescence or apoptosis through p53-dependent pathways, serving as a tumor-suppressive barrier. Dyskeratosis congenita and related telomere biology disorders caused by mutations in telomerase components or shelterin proteins manifest as bone marrow failure, pulmonary fibrosis, and premature aging phenotypes.
