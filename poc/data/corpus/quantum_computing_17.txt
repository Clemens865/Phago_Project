Quantum chemistry simulation on quantum computers promises to solve the electronic structure problem for molecular systems with exponential quantum advantage over classical methods limited by the exponential scaling of the many-body Hilbert space dimension with the number of electrons. The quantum phase estimation algorithm provides an exact method for determining molecular ground-state energies by encoding the molecular Hamiltonian as a unitary operator and extracting its eigenvalues through controlled operations and an inverse quantum Fourier transform, requiring fault-tolerant quantum hardware with thousands of logical qubits. The Jordan-Wigner and Bravyi-Kitaev transformations map the fermionic molecular Hamiltonian to a qubit Hamiltonian by encoding the occupation number and parity information of molecular orbitals in qubit states, with the Bravyi-Kitaev transformation offering improved locality at the cost of a more complex mapping. Active space methods reduce the computational requirements by treating only a subset of molecular orbitals quantum mechanically while describing the remaining electrons with classical mean-field methods, enabling the simulation of catalytic active sites and transition metal complexes with near-term quantum hardware. Quantum simulation of chemical dynamics, including nonadiabatic processes involving multiple electronic states and nuclear quantum effects such as proton tunneling, represents a frontier application where quantum computers could provide insights inaccessible to classical simulation. First-quantized approaches that directly encode the positions of electrons in a spatial grid offer asymptotic advantages for plane-wave basis sets and periodic systems, with algorithms based on qubitization and quantum signal processing achieving optimal query complexity. Resource estimates for practically useful quantum chemistry simulations suggest that factoring-scale quantum computers with millions of physical qubits and error rates below 0.1 percent will be required to surpass the accuracy of classical methods such as coupled cluster with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples for industrially relevant molecules including drug candidates and catalyst intermediates.
