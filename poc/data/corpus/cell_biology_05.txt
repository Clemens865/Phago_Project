Apoptosis is programmed cell death essential for development and tissue homeostasis. Intrinsic apoptosis is triggered by mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization releasing cytochrome c into the cytoplasm. Caspase enzymes execute the dismantling of cellular components. The cell shrinks, chromatin condenses, and apoptotic bodies are formed for phagocytic clearance.
