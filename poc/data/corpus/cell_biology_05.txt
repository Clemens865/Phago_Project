Apoptosis is a genetically encoded program of cell death essential for embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, and immune system function in multicellular organisms, distinguished from necrosis by its orderly, non-inflammatory dismantling of cellular contents. The intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway is triggered by intracellular stress signals such as DNA damage, oxidative stress, or growth factor withdrawal, which shift the balance of pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family members (BAX, BAK) over anti-apoptotic counterparts (BCL-2, BCL-XL), leading to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and the release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm. Cytochrome c binds the adaptor protein APAF-1 to form the apoptosome, a heptameric complex that recruits and activates the initiator caspase-9, which in turn cleaves and activates executioner caspases-3 and caspase-7. The extrinsic pathway is initiated by death ligands such as Fas ligand, TNF-alpha, and TRAIL binding to death receptors on the cell surface, recruiting the adaptor protein FADD and activating caspase-8 through the death-inducing signaling complex. Executioner caspases systematically dismantle the cell by cleaving structural proteins, activating endonucleases such as CAD (caspase-activated DNase) that fragment chromosomal DNA, and exposing phosphatidylserine on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane as an eat-me signal for phagocytic clearance. Inhibitors of apoptosis proteins, including XIAP and survivin, provide a regulatory checkpoint by directly binding caspases, while Smac/DIABLO released from mitochondria antagonizes these inhibitors. For example, during T-cell development in the thymus, apoptosis eliminates autoreactive lymphocytes through negative selection, preventing autoimmune disease and demonstrating how programmed cell death sculpts the adaptive immune repertoire.
