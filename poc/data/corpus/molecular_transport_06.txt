Calcium signaling is a ubiquitous intracellular communication mechanism in which transient elevations of cytosolic calcium ion concentration from a resting level of approximately 100 nanomolar to micromolar peaks encode information through the amplitude, frequency, and spatial pattern of calcium oscillations. The endoplasmic reticulum serves as the principal intracellular calcium store, with the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase continuously pumping calcium ions into the lumen against their concentration gradient at the expense of ATP hydrolysis. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane release stored calcium in response to IP3 generated by phospholipase C activation downstream of G-protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases. Ryanodine receptors, the predominant calcium release channels in skeletal and cardiac muscle, mediate calcium-induced calcium release during excitation-contraction coupling, with the type 1 ryanodine receptor in skeletal muscle directly coupled to the dihydropyridine receptor voltage sensor in the transverse tubule membrane. Store-operated calcium entry through ORAI1 channels in the plasma membrane is activated when endoplasmic reticulum calcium depletion is sensed by the luminal calcium sensor STIM1, which oligomerizes and translocates to endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane junctions to directly gate ORAI channels. Calcium-binding effector proteins including calmodulin, calcineurin, and protein kinase C decode calcium signals into downstream cellular responses. Calmodulin undergoes conformational changes upon binding four calcium ions that expose hydrophobic surfaces for interaction with target enzymes including CaM kinase II, myosin light chain kinase, and calcineurin. Mitochondrial calcium uptake through the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex stimulates the activity of matrix dehydrogenases and ATP synthesis but can trigger the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and apoptosis when calcium overload occurs.
