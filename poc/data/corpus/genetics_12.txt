DNA damage repair mechanisms constitute a sophisticated surveillance and restoration system that maintains genomic integrity in the face of tens of thousands of DNA lesions generated daily in each human cell by endogenous reactive oxygen species, replication errors, and exogenous mutagens. Base excision repair addresses small non-helix-distorting lesions such as oxidized bases, deaminated cytosines, and alkylated purines through the sequential action of DNA glycosylases that recognize and excise the damaged base, AP endonuclease that cleaves the abasic site, DNA polymerase beta that fills the single-nucleotide gap, and DNA ligase III that seals the nick. Nucleotide excision repair removes bulky helix-distorting adducts including cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts through a mechanism involving damage recognition by XPC-RAD23B, unwinding of the DNA duplex by the TFIIH helicase complex, dual incision by the endonucleases XPF-ERCC1 and XPG, and gap filling by replicative polymerases. Mismatch repair corrects base-base mismatches and insertion-deletion loops that escape proofreading by replicative polymerases, with the MutS-alpha complex of MSH2-MSH6 recognizing mismatches and the MutL-alpha complex of MLH1-PMS2 coordinating strand discrimination and excision. Double-strand break repair proceeds through two major pathways: non-homologous end joining, which directly ligates broken ends through the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer and DNA-PKcs, and homologous recombination, which uses the sister chromatid as a template for accurate repair during S and G2 phases. Defects in DNA repair underlie hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes, with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations impairing homologous recombination and conferring susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancers that can be therapeutically exploited through synthetic lethality with PARP inhibitors.
