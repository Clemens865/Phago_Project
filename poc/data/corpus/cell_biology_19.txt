The extracellular matrix is a complex three-dimensional network of macromolecules secreted by cells that provides structural support, biochemical signaling, and mechanical cues essential for tissue architecture and cellular behavior. Collagens constitute the most abundant structural proteins in the extracellular matrix, with fibrillar collagens types I, II, and III forming tensile-resistant fibers through a hierarchical assembly of triple-helical tropocollagen molecules into staggered microfibrils cross-linked by lysyl oxidase. Proteoglycans such as aggrecan, decorin, and perlecan consist of core proteins decorated with glycosaminoglycan chains including chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate, and hyaluronan that attract water molecules and create a hydrated gel resistant to compressive forces. Fibronectin is a multidomain glycoprotein that assembles into fibrils through cell-mediated processes requiring integrin engagement and cytoskeletal tension, forming a provisional matrix critical for wound healing and embryonic development. Laminins are heterotrimeric glycoproteins composed of alpha, beta, and gamma chains that self-assemble into sheet-like networks within basement membranes, providing a specialized extracellular matrix underlying epithelial and endothelial tissues. Matrix metalloproteinases, a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases including collagenases, gelatinases, and stromelysins, degrade extracellular matrix components during tissue remodeling, with their activity tightly controlled by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases. The concept of matrikines refers to bioactive fragments released by proteolytic cleavage of matrix molecules that exert signaling functions distinct from their parent proteins. Mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix, including stiffness measured in kilopascals, are sensed by cells through integrin-mediated mechanotransduction and profoundly influence stem cell fate decisions, fibrosis progression, and tumor invasion.
