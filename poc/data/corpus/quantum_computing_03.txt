Quantum gates are the building blocks of quantum circuits, implementing unitary transformations on one or more qubits that are reversible, preserve the norm of quantum states, and constitute the quantum analogue of classical logic gates used in conventional digital computation. The Hadamard gate is a fundamental single-qubit gate that maps the basis state ket-zero to an equal superposition of ket-zero and ket-one with positive relative phase, and maps ket-one to a superposition with negative relative phase, effectively rotating the qubit state by pi radians about the axis diagonal between the X and Z axes on the Bloch sphere. The controlled-NOT or CNOT gate is the prototypical two-qubit gate that flips the state of a target qubit conditioned on the control qubit being in state one, and when combined with arbitrary single-qubit rotations forms a universal gate set capable of approximating any unitary operation on n qubits to arbitrary precision, as established by the Solovay-Kitaev theorem. Other essential gates include the Pauli X, Y, and Z gates corresponding to rotations of pi about the respective Bloch sphere axes, the phase gate S and T gates that introduce phase shifts of pi over two and pi over four, and the Toffoli gate, a three-qubit controlled-controlled-NOT gate that is universal for classical reversible computation. Quantum circuits compose gates in sequence and parallel, with circuit depth measuring the number of sequential gate layers and directly determining susceptibility to decoherence errors, making circuit optimization through gate synthesis and compilation a critical challenge for near-term quantum computing. For example, the quantum Fourier transform circuit on n qubits requires only order n-squared Hadamard and controlled-phase rotation gates with logarithmic depth, compared to the order n-log-n operations of the classical fast Fourier transform, providing the exponential advantage at the heart of Shor's factoring algorithm and quantum phase estimation.
