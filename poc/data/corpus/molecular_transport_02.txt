Passive transport occurs down the concentration gradient without energy expenditure. Simple diffusion allows small nonpolar molecules like oxygen and carbon dioxide to cross the lipid bilayer directly. Facilitated diffusion uses channel proteins and carrier proteins to transport polar molecules and ions. Aquaporins are specialized water channels that enable rapid osmosis across cell membranes.
