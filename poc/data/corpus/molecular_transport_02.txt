Passive transport is the spontaneous movement of molecules across biological membranes down their electrochemical gradient without the direct expenditure of metabolic energy, driven by the thermodynamic tendency to increase entropy and reach equilibrium. Simple diffusion allows small nonpolar molecules such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitric oxide, and steroid hormones to cross the lipid bilayer directly at rates proportional to the concentration gradient and the membrane permeability coefficient described by Fick's first law of diffusion. Facilitated diffusion employs transmembrane protein mediators to transport hydrophilic and charged solutes that cannot permeate the hydrophobic core of the bilayer, achieving transport rates that exhibit saturation kinetics analogous to enzyme-substrate interactions. Channel proteins form aqueous pores that allow specific ions to flow passively at rates approaching the diffusion limit, with selectivity determined by the size and charge of the pore constriction, as exemplified by potassium channels whose selectivity filter discriminates K+ from the smaller Na+ ion through precise coordination of carbonyl oxygen atoms. Carrier proteins undergo conformational changes to shuttle substrates across the membrane, as seen in the GLUT family of glucose transporters that mediate insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes and skeletal muscle. Aquaporins are tetrameric water channels that enable osmotic water flow at rates of up to three billion water molecules per second per channel while excluding proton conductance through an electrostatic barrier in the channel pore. For example, in the alveoli of the lungs, the rapid passive diffusion of oxygen from inspired air into pulmonary capillary blood and the simultaneous efflux of carbon dioxide depend on the extremely thin alveolar-capillary barrier and the steep partial pressure gradients maintained by continuous ventilation and perfusion, demonstrating how passive transport principles underpin gas exchange in respiratory physiology.
