Gene therapy encompasses strategies for treating disease by delivering functional genetic material into patient cells to correct or compensate for defective genes, with approaches ranging from gene replacement and gene addition to gene editing and gene silencing. Adeno-associated virus vectors have emerged as the leading platform for in vivo gene delivery due to their lack of pathogenicity, ability to transduce both dividing and non-dividing cells, and tissue tropism determined by capsid serotype, with AAV9 efficiently crossing the blood-brain barrier and AAV8 exhibiting hepatotropism. Lentiviral vectors derived from HIV-1 integrate their genetic payload into the host genome, providing stable long-term transgene expression critical for ex vivo gene therapy of hematopoietic stem cells, as exemplified by the successful treatment of sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia using LentiGlobin vectors encoding modified beta-globin transgenes. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing has revolutionized the precision of gene therapy by enabling targeted correction of disease-causing mutations through homology-directed repair or disruption of deleterious alleles through non-homologous end joining. Base editors, comprising catalytically impaired Cas9 fused to deaminase enzymes, convert specific nucleotides without generating double-strand breaks, with cytosine base editors converting C-to-T and adenine base editors converting A-to-G at programmable genomic locations. Prime editing extends the capabilities of gene editing by using a reverse transcriptase fused to nickase Cas9 guided by a prime editing guide RNA to install any point mutation, small insertion, or small deletion without double-strand breaks or donor templates. Challenges facing gene therapy include immunogenicity of viral capsids and Cas9 protein, insertional mutagenesis from integrating vectors, off-target editing events, limited packaging capacity of adeno-associated virus vectors, and the high manufacturing costs that currently restrict access to these transformative medicines.
