Cell polarity refers to the asymmetric organization of cellular components along defined axes, a fundamental property that underlies epithelial barrier function, directed cell migration, asymmetric cell division, and neuronal signal propagation. In epithelial cells, the apical-basolateral axis is established and maintained by three evolutionarily conserved polarity complexes: the PAR complex comprising PAR3, PAR6, and atypical protein kinase C, the Crumbs complex containing CRB3, PALS1, and PATJ, and the Scribble complex composed of Scribble, Discs Large, and Lethal Giant Larvae. These complexes engage in mutual antagonism through phosphorylation-dependent exclusion mechanisms that segregate apical and basolateral membrane identity. Phosphoinositide asymmetry reinforces epithelial polarity, with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate enriched at the apical membrane and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate concentrated at the basolateral domain through the opposing activities of PTEN and PI3-kinase. During directed cell migration, the Rho family GTPases CDC42, Rac1, and RhoA establish front-rear polarity by coordinating actin polymerization at the leading edge with actomyosin contractility at the cell rear. The Golgi apparatus and microtubule-organizing center reorient toward the direction of migration in response to CDC42 activation, positioning secretory vesicle delivery to the advancing membrane. Planar cell polarity, the coordinated alignment of cells within the tissue plane, is governed by the Frizzled-Dishevelled-Van Gogh signaling module and is essential for convergent extension movements during gastrulation and the oriented arrangement of stereocilia in the inner ear. Disruption of polarity pathways contributes to cystic kidney disease, neural tube defects, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in carcinogenesis.
