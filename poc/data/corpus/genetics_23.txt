Phylogenetics is the study of evolutionary relationships among biological entities, reconstructed from molecular sequence data using computational methods that infer tree topologies representing the branching pattern of descent from common ancestors. Multiple sequence alignment, performed by algorithms such as MUSCLE, MAFFT, and ClustalOmega, establishes positional homology among nucleotide or amino acid sequences and serves as the input for phylogenetic inference methods. Distance-based methods, including neighbor-joining, compute pairwise evolutionary distances between sequences using substitution models and construct trees by iteratively joining the closest pair of operational taxonomic units. Maximum parsimony seeks the tree topology that requires the fewest evolutionary changes to explain the observed sequence variation, although this criterion can be inconsistent under conditions of long-branch attraction where rapidly evolving lineages are artifactually grouped together. Maximum likelihood estimation evaluates the probability of the observed sequence data given a tree topology, branch lengths, and a model of nucleotide or amino acid substitution, with model selection criteria such as the Akaike information criterion guiding the choice of substitution model. Bayesian phylogenetic inference, implemented in programs such as MrBayes and BEAST, samples tree topologies and parameters from their posterior probability distribution using Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, providing a natural framework for incorporating prior information and quantifying uncertainty through posterior probabilities. Molecular clock models estimate divergence times by calibrating the rate of molecular evolution against fossil or geological evidence, with relaxed clock models allowing rate variation among lineages. Phylogenomic approaches leverage hundreds or thousands of orthologous gene alignments to resolve deep evolutionary relationships, with concatenation and coalescent-based species tree methods addressing discordance between gene trees caused by incomplete lineage sorting, horizontal gene transfer, and gene duplication and loss.
