Ion channel gating refers to the conformational transitions that open and close the conductive pore of ion channel proteins in response to specific stimuli, thereby controlling the selective passage of ions across biological membranes with remarkable speed and fidelity. Voltage-gated ion channels, including the sodium, potassium, and calcium channel families, sense changes in membrane potential through positively charged arginine and lysine residues in the S4 transmembrane segment, which undergoes an outward displacement upon depolarization to initiate channel opening. The voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.2, resolved by X-ray crystallography, revealed a modular architecture with a central pore domain containing the selectivity filter and four peripheral voltage-sensing domains connected by S4-S5 linker helices that couple voltage sensor movement to pore gate opening. Inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels occurs through a fast ball-and-chain mechanism in which the cytoplasmic loop between domains III and IV occludes the inner vestibule of the pore within milliseconds of channel opening, limiting the duration of sodium influx during action potential generation. Ligand-gated ion channels, exemplified by the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and ionotropic glutamate receptors, undergo conformational changes upon agonist binding to their extracellular domains that are allosterically transmitted to the transmembrane pore region. The NMDA receptor requires coincident binding of glutamate and glycine as co-agonists together with membrane depolarization sufficient to relieve voltage-dependent magnesium block of the pore, functioning as a molecular coincidence detector for Hebbian synaptic plasticity. Mechanosensitive channels, including the Piezo1 and Piezo2 proteins, respond to membrane tension and shear forces through their propeller-shaped architecture that flattens upon mechanical stimulation to open a central pore. Channelopathies arising from mutations in ion channel genes cause a diverse spectrum of diseases including epilepsy, cardiac arrhythmias, myotonia, and cystic fibrosis.
