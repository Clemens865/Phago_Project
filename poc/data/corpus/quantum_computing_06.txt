Quantum teleportation is a protocol for transferring the quantum state of one particle to another spatially distant particle without physically transmitting the particle itself, utilizing the resource of shared entanglement and classical communication. The protocol begins with Alice and Bob sharing a maximally entangled Bell pair, after which Alice performs a joint Bell state measurement on her half of the entangled pair together with the unknown quantum state she wishes to teleport. This measurement projects the two qubits at Alice's location into one of four Bell states, simultaneously collapsing Bob's qubit into a state that is related to the original by one of four possible unitary transformations. Alice communicates her two-bit classical measurement outcome to Bob, who applies the corresponding Pauli correction operator to his qubit, thereby reconstructing the exact quantum state that Alice possessed, completing the teleportation. The no-cloning theorem ensures that the original state at Alice's location is destroyed during the Bell measurement, preserving the fundamental principle that quantum information cannot be duplicated. Quantum teleportation does not enable faster-than-light communication because the classical channel carrying the measurement result is required for Bob to reconstruct the state, limiting the protocol to the speed of classical information transfer. Experimental demonstrations of quantum teleportation have been achieved across increasingly impressive distances, from tabletop optical experiments to satellite-based teleportation over 1,400 kilometers using the Micius satellite. Quantum teleportation serves as a fundamental primitive for quantum communication networks, quantum error correction through teleportation-based gates, and measurement-based quantum computation. Entanglement swapping, an extension of quantum teleportation, enables the establishment of entanglement between particles that have never directly interacted by teleporting an entangled state through an intermediate node, forming the basis for quantum repeater architectures in long-distance quantum networks.
