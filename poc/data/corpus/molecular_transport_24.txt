Cytoplasmic dynein is a minus-end-directed microtubule motor complex that generates the force for retrograde transport of organelles, signaling endosomes, and viral particles toward the centrosome and cell center, and additionally powers chromosome movements during mitosis and drives ciliary and flagellar beating. The cytoplasmic dynein-1 holoenzyme is composed of two heavy chains each containing a ring of six AAA-plus ATPase domains that form the motor, a microtubule-binding stalk extending from AAA4, a linker domain that undergoes conformational changes coupled to the ATP hydrolysis cycle, and a tail domain that engages the dynactin activating complex and various cargo adaptors. Dynactin, an essential cofactor for nearly all cytoplasmic dynein functions, is a megadalton-scale complex built around a short actin-related protein 1 filament capped by CapZ at its barbed end, with the p150Glued subunit projecting from the filament to interact with both the dynein tail and the microtubule surface. Processivity of the dynein-dynactin complex requires an activating adaptor from the BICD, HOOK, or NIN family that bridges the dynein tail and the dynactin pointed-end complex, converting dynein from a diffusive motor into a processive transporter capable of taking multiple consecutive steps along the microtubule. The recruitment of multiple dynein dimers to a single dynactin scaffold by certain adaptors enables the generation of higher forces and faster velocities required for the transport of large organelles. During mitosis, dynein at the cell cortex generates pulling forces on astral microtubules to position the mitotic spindle, while dynein at kinetochores contributes to chromosome congression and the silencing of the spindle assembly checkpoint. Mutations in dynein heavy chain DYNC1H1 and dynactin subunit DCTN1 cause neurodegenerative diseases including spinal muscular atrophy with lower extremity predominance and Perry syndrome, reflecting the critical importance of dynein-mediated transport in neurons with their extreme axonal lengths.
