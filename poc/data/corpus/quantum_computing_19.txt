Quantum supremacy, also termed quantum computational advantage, refers to the experimental demonstration that a programmable quantum device can perform a specific computational task that is infeasible for any classical computer within a reasonable time frame. Google's 2019 Sycamore experiment claimed quantum supremacy by sampling from the output distribution of a random quantum circuit on 53 superconducting qubits in 200 seconds, a task estimated to require 10,000 years on the most powerful classical supercomputer at the time. The random circuit sampling problem leverages the computational complexity conjecture that the output distributions of sufficiently deep random quantum circuits are hard to sample from classically, with the Porter-Thomas distribution of output probabilities serving as a signature of quantum chaotic dynamics inaccessible to efficient classical simulation. IBM challenged Google's supremacy claim by demonstrating that classical simulation using tensor network methods with sufficient disk storage could reproduce the Sycamore results in days rather than millennia, sparking an ongoing arms race between quantum experiments and classical simulation techniques. The Chinese Jiuzhang photonic experiment demonstrated quantum advantage through Gaussian boson sampling, a task related to computing the permanents of complex matrices that is believed to be classically intractable, using 76 detected photons from a network of beam splitters and squeezed light sources. Cross-entropy benchmarking serves as the verification protocol for random circuit sampling experiments, measuring the correlation between observed output bitstring probabilities and their ideal theoretical values, with a linear cross-entropy fidelity significantly above zero indicating genuine quantum computational advantage. The practical utility of quantum supremacy demonstrations has been debated, as the demonstrated tasks are specifically designed to be classically hard rather than to solve practical problems, motivating the pursuit of quantum utility demonstrations that address real-world computational challenges with near-term quantum devices.
