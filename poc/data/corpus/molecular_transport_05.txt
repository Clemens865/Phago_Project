Signal transduction pathways relay extracellular signals to intracellular responses. G-protein coupled receptors activate second messenger cascades involving cyclic AMP and calcium ions. Receptor tyrosine kinases trigger phosphorylation cascades through MAP kinase signaling. Ion channels open in response to ligand binding or voltage changes to allow rapid ion flux across membranes.
