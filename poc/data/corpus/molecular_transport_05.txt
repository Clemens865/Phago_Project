Signal transduction is the process by which extracellular chemical or physical stimuli are converted into specific intracellular responses through cascades of molecular interactions involving receptors, second messengers, protein kinases, and transcription factors. G-protein coupled receptors constitute the largest family of cell surface receptors, comprising seven transmembrane alpha-helical domains that undergo conformational changes upon ligand binding to activate heterotrimeric G-proteins by catalyzing the exchange of GDP for GTP on the G-alpha subunit, which then dissociates from the G-beta-gamma dimer to modulate downstream effectors such as adenylyl cyclase, phospholipase C, and ion channels. Adenylyl cyclase converts ATP to the second messenger cyclic AMP, which activates protein kinase A to phosphorylate serine and threonine residues on target proteins, while phospholipase C cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to generate inositol trisphosphate, which triggers calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum, and diacylglycerol, which activates protein kinase C. Receptor tyrosine kinases, including the epidermal growth factor receptor and insulin receptor, signal through autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues that recruit SH2 domain-containing adaptor proteins such as Grb2, initiating the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade that ultimately activates transcription factors controlling cell proliferation and differentiation. Signal amplification occurs at multiple steps in these cascades, enabling a single ligand-receptor interaction to generate thousands of second messenger molecules and activate numerous downstream kinases. For example, in cardiac myocytes, binding of epinephrine to beta-1 adrenergic receptors activates the Gs-adenylyl cyclase-cAMP-PKA pathway, which phosphorylates L-type calcium channels, ryanodine receptors, and phospholamban, collectively increasing intracellular calcium transients and contractile force to produce the characteristic positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of sympathetic stimulation on heart function.
