Epigenetics encompasses heritable changes in gene expression that occur without alterations to the underlying DNA sequence, with DNA methylation representing one of the most extensively studied epigenetic modifications. DNA methyltransferases DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B catalyze the addition of a methyl group to the 5-carbon position of cytosine residues, predominantly within CpG dinucleotides, generating 5-methylcytosine that is recognized by methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins. DNMT1 functions as a maintenance methyltransferase that copies methylation patterns to the newly synthesized strand during DNA replication by recognizing hemimethylated CpG sites through its interaction with UHRF1, ensuring epigenetic inheritance across cell divisions. In contrast, DNMT3A and DNMT3B establish de novo methylation patterns during embryonic development and gametogenesis, guided by interactions with the catalytically inactive regulatory factor DNMT3L. CpG islands, defined as genomic regions of at least 200 base pairs with a GC content exceeding 50 percent, are found at approximately 70 percent of human gene promoters and are typically maintained in an unmethylated state that permits transcriptional activity. Promoter hypermethylation silences tumor suppressor genes in cancer through the recruitment of methyl-binding proteins such as MeCP2, which engage histone deacetylase complexes to establish repressive chromatin states. Active DNA demethylation is mediated by the ten-eleven translocation family of dioxygenases that iteratively oxidize 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, 5-formylcytosine, and 5-carboxylcytosine, which are subsequently excised by thymine DNA glycosylase and replaced with unmodified cytosine through base excision repair. Genome-wide methylation profiling using bisulfite sequencing has revealed that aberrant methylation landscapes are hallmarks of aging, neuropsychiatric disorders, and virtually all human cancers.
