MicroRNAs are endogenous small non-coding RNA molecules of approximately 22 nucleotides that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally by binding to the 3-prime untranslated regions of target messenger RNAs through imperfect base complementarity. The biogenesis of microRNAs begins with transcription of primary microRNA transcripts by RNA polymerase II, producing long capped and polyadenylated precursors that contain one or more hairpin structures. The microprocessor complex, consisting of the RNase III enzyme Drosha and its double-stranded RNA-binding partner DGCR8, cleaves the primary transcript at the base of the hairpin to release the precursor microRNA of approximately 70 nucleotides, which is exported from the nucleus through Exportin-5 in a Ran-GTP-dependent manner. In the cytoplasm, Dicer cleaves the precursor hairpin to generate a mature microRNA duplex, from which the functional guide strand is incorporated into the microRNA-induced silencing complex containing Argonaute proteins. A single microRNA can regulate hundreds of target genes, and conversely individual mRNAs frequently contain binding sites for multiple microRNAs in their 3-prime untranslated regions, creating complex regulatory networks. The seed sequence, comprising nucleotides 2 through 8 of the microRNA, is the primary determinant of target recognition, with perfect seed complementarity being both necessary and sufficient for functional repression in most cases. MicroRNA dysregulation has been implicated in virtually every human disease category, with oncogenic microRNAs such as miR-21 and miR-155 promoting tumor progression and tumor-suppressive microRNAs including the let-7 family and miR-34a inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis. Circulating microRNAs in blood plasma have emerged as promising non-invasive biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, cardiovascular disease stratification, and monitoring of treatment response.
