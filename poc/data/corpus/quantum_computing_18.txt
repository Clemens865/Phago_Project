Quantum communication networks are distributed quantum information systems that connect remote quantum nodes through quantum channels carrying entangled photons, enabling applications including quantum key distribution, distributed quantum computing, quantum secret sharing, and quantum-secured communication. The architecture of a quantum network comprises quantum nodes equipped with quantum memories and local processing capabilities, quantum channels typically implemented as optical fibers or free-space links carrying single photons, and classical channels for synchronization and protocol coordination. Quantum repeaters overcome the exponential photon loss in optical fibers by dividing long-distance links into shorter segments connected by intermediate nodes that generate, purify, and swap entanglement through a hierarchical protocol, with first-generation repeaters using heralded entanglement generation and entanglement purification, and third-generation repeaters employing quantum error correction codes to encode logical qubits in multi-photon states. Quantum memories based on atomic ensembles, rare-earth-doped crystals, nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, and trapped ions store quantum states of single photons for the milliseconds to seconds required to synchronize entanglement distribution across network segments. The quantum internet envisions a global network capable of distributing entanglement between any two nodes on demand, with a layered functional classification ranging from trusted-node quantum key distribution networks already deployed in metropolitan areas to fully fault-tolerant quantum networks supporting blind quantum computation. Satellite-based quantum communication, demonstrated by the Chinese QUESS mission, provides an alternative to fiber-based distribution for intercontinental distances where free-space photon loss scales more favorably than the exponential attenuation in optical fiber. Multiplexing strategies using wavelength-division, time-division, and spatial-mode multiplexing increase the entanglement distribution rate of quantum networks by simultaneously transmitting multiple quantum channels. Integration of quantum networks with classical telecommunications infrastructure through wavelength conversion between telecom-band photons suitable for fiber transmission and visible-wavelength photons compatible with atomic quantum memories is a critical engineering challenge.
