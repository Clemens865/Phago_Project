Non-coding RNA encompasses the vast repertoire of RNA molecules transcribed from the genome that do not encode proteins but perform essential regulatory, structural, and catalytic functions across all domains of life. Long non-coding RNAs, defined as transcripts exceeding 200 nucleotides without protein-coding potential, number in the tens of thousands in the human genome and participate in diverse processes including X-chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting, chromatin remodeling, and transcriptional regulation. XIST, the prototypical long non-coding RNA, coats one X chromosome in female mammals and recruits Polycomb repressive complex 2 to deposit H3K27me3, initiating chromosome-wide transcriptional silencing that achieves dosage compensation between sexes. HOTAIR, transcribed from the HOXC locus, acts in trans to recruit PRC2 and the LSD1-CoREST demethylase complex to the HOXD locus, repressing transcription of developmental genes across chromosomal distances. Circular RNAs, generated by back-splicing events that covalently join a downstream 5-prime splice site to an upstream 3-prime splice site, are abundantly expressed in brain tissue and function as microRNA sponges, protein scaffolds, and regulators of transcription. Ribosomal RNAs and transfer RNAs, the most abundant non-coding RNA species, perform the catalytic and adaptor functions essential for protein synthesis on the ribosome. Small nucleolar RNAs guide the chemical modification of ribosomal RNA through 2-prime-O-methylation by box C/D snoRNAs and pseudouridylation by box H/ACA snoRNAs. Enhancer RNAs, transcribed from active enhancer elements, stabilize enhancer-promoter chromatin loops and facilitate transcription factor recruitment. The rapidly expanding catalog of functional non-coding RNAs has overturned the view of non-coding DNA as junk, revealing a pervasive regulatory layer encoded within the genome.
