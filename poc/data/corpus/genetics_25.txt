Horizontal gene transfer is the transmission of genetic material between organisms through mechanisms other than vertical inheritance from parent to offspring, a process that has profoundly shaped the evolution of prokaryotic genomes and challenges the strictly bifurcating tree model of evolutionary relationships. Transformation, the uptake of free DNA from the environment by naturally competent bacteria, involves the binding of double-stranded DNA to surface receptors, transport across the cell envelope through the competence machinery, and recombination of the internalized single strand into the recipient chromosome by RecA-mediated homologous recombination. Conjugation transfers DNA between bacterial cells through direct physical contact mediated by a type IV secretion system, with F-plasmid-encoded tra genes directing the assembly of the conjugation pilus and the single-stranded DNA transfer of the plasmid from donor to recipient through rolling circle replication. Transduction occurs when bacteriophages inadvertently package segments of the host chromosome into phage particles and deliver this DNA to new bacterial hosts upon subsequent infection, with generalized transduction transferring random chromosomal fragments and specialized transduction transferring genes adjacent to the prophage integration site. Genomic islands, large chromosomal segments acquired by horizontal transfer recognizable by their atypical GC content and codon usage relative to the host genome, frequently encode virulence factors, antibiotic resistance determinants, and metabolic capabilities that confer selective advantages in specific ecological niches. The dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes among pathogenic bacteria through horizontal transfer on mobile genetic elements including conjugative plasmids, integrons, and transposons represents a critical public health challenge. Comparative genomics has revealed that horizontal gene transfer is unexpectedly common among eukaryotes as well, with endosymbiotic gene transfer from mitochondrial and plastid genomes to the nucleus representing a major evolutionary force, and examples of gene acquisition from bacteria to fungi, plants, and even animals documented across diverse taxonomic groups.
