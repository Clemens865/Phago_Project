Quantum machine learning investigates the intersection of quantum computing and artificial intelligence, exploring whether quantum algorithms can provide computational advantages for learning tasks including classification, regression, generative modeling, and reinforcement learning. Quantum kernel methods encode classical data into quantum states through feature maps implemented as parameterized quantum circuits, then compute kernel matrix entries as the overlap between quantum feature states, potentially accessing exponentially large Hilbert spaces that are intractable for classical kernel evaluations. Variational quantum classifiers employ parameterized quantum circuits as trainable models that process quantum-encoded input data and produce measurement outcomes interpreted as class predictions, with circuit parameters optimized through hybrid quantum-classical training loops using gradient-based or gradient-free optimization. Quantum neural networks, implemented as alternating layers of parameterized single-qubit rotations and entangling gates, face the challenge of barren plateaus where the variance of the cost function gradient vanishes exponentially with the number of qubits, potentially negating any quantum advantage for generic circuit architectures. The quantum advantage for machine learning remains an active research question, with provable exponential speedups demonstrated only for contrived problems involving quantum data or specific algebraic structures, while advantages for practical classical datasets are less clear. Quantum generative adversarial networks pit a quantum generator circuit against a classical or quantum discriminator to learn probability distributions, with theoretical arguments suggesting that certain quantum distributions may be exponentially hard for classical generative models to approximate. Quantum reservoir computing exploits the complex dynamics of quantum systems as a computational resource, mapping input data to quantum states whose measurements serve as features for classical machine learning algorithms. Applications of quantum machine learning to quantum chemistry, drug discovery, financial modeling, and high-energy physics have been explored on near-term quantum devices, although the practical utility of these applications compared to purely classical approaches requires careful benchmarking accounting for all overheads of quantum data encoding and measurement.
