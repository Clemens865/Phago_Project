RNA interference is a conserved post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism in which small double-stranded RNA molecules guide the sequence-specific degradation or translational repression of complementary messenger RNA targets. The pathway is initiated when long double-stranded RNA precursors, either exogenous or derived from convergent transcription, are processed by the RNase III enzyme Dicer into small interfering RNA duplexes of 21 to 23 nucleotides with characteristic two-nucleotide 3-prime overhangs and 5-prime phosphate groups. One strand of the siRNA duplex, designated the guide strand, is loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex containing an Argonaute protein, while the passenger strand is cleaved and discarded through a process termed RISC loading that is influenced by thermodynamic asymmetry at the duplex termini. The guide strand directs Argonaute to complementary mRNA targets, where perfect base pairing triggers endonucleolytic cleavage of the target between positions 10 and 11 of the guide strand by the catalytic PIWI domain of Argonaute-2. In plants and nematodes, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases amplify the silencing signal by synthesizing secondary siRNAs from cleaved target mRNAs, a phenomenon termed transitivity that enables systemic spreading of the silencing response. RNA interference has been harnessed as a powerful research tool for loss-of-function studies using chemically synthesized siRNAs or vector-expressed short hairpin RNAs that are processed by Dicer into functional siRNAs. Therapeutic applications of RNA interference have culminated in FDA-approved drugs such as patisiran, which delivers lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated siRNAs targeting transthyretin mRNA for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis. Challenges in siRNA therapeutics include off-target effects mediated by seed region complementarity, immune stimulation through Toll-like receptor recognition of double-stranded RNA, and efficient delivery to target tissues beyond the liver.
