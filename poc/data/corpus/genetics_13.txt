Population genetics is the study of allele frequency distributions and their changes within populations under the influences of natural selection, genetic drift, mutation, gene flow, and non-random mating. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium provides the null model for population genetics, predicting that allele and genotype frequencies remain constant across generations in an idealized infinite population with random mating, no selection, no mutation, and no migration. Deviations from Hardy-Weinberg expectations at specific loci can indicate the action of evolutionary forces, population substructure, or non-random mating patterns such as inbreeding or assortative mating. Natural selection acts on phenotypic variation with a heritable genetic basis, with directional selection shifting allele frequencies toward advantageous variants, balancing selection maintaining polymorphism through heterozygote advantage or frequency-dependent mechanisms, and purifying selection removing deleterious mutations. The neutral theory of molecular evolution, proposed by Motoo Kimura, posits that the majority of molecular polymorphisms and substitutions are selectively neutral and governed primarily by genetic drift, with the rate of neutral substitution equal to the mutation rate. Effective population size, a central parameter in population genetics, determines the relative importance of drift versus selection, with smaller effective populations experiencing stronger stochastic fluctuations in allele frequencies. The coalescent framework provides a retrospective model for tracing the genealogical history of alleles sampled from a population, enabling inference of demographic parameters including population size changes, divergence times, and migration rates from genetic data. Genome-wide association studies exploit population-level linkage disequilibrium between causal variants and genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms to identify genetic loci associated with complex traits and diseases.
